    "body": "First thanks for aruba :tada: \r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI upgraded aruba in simplecov from 0.7 to 0.14.2. One spec started failing, basically it configures a different directory for simplecovs output as:\r\n\r\n      SimpleCov.start do\r\n        coverage_dir '/tmp/test/simplecov'\r\n      end\r\n\r\nThe test asserting that the directory exists started failing, and I fear that it also won't find the files I'm checking for.\r\n\r\nIt is imo because the method:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      def directory?(file)\r\n        Aruba.platform.directory? expand_path(file)\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\ncalls out to `expand_path` which gets the path wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1] pry(#<Object>)> file\r\n=> \"/tmp/test/simplecov\"\r\n[2] pry(#<Object>)> expand_path(file)\r\n=> \"/home/tobi/github/simplecov/tmp/aruba/project/tmp/test/simplecov\"\r\n```\r\nSo `/tmp/test/simplecov` exists (and we created it using `File.mkdir_p`) but the path aruba thinks that it should be does not exist, hence the test fails ([this is the test](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/blob/master/features/config_coverage_dir.feature#L22-L33))\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect aruba to find directories/files created by my application in the tests. \r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nAruba looks in its working directory not the actual absolute path.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nOne could check if the path is absolute and then just not expand it and everything should work fine.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n\r\n[scenario failing when updating aruba](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/blob/master/features/config_coverage_dir.feature#L22-L33)\r\n\r\nBasically just running `directory?('/some/absolute/path')` seems to fail for me.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nPeople might wanna put their simplecov coverage reports in an absolute path to gather them or whatever. I wanna make sure they can do that.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n* Version used: 0.14.2\r\n* Operating System and version:\r\n  * Linux Mint 18.2\r\n  * `uname -a`: Linux speedy 4.10.0-32-generic #36~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 9 09:19:02 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n* Link to your project: https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov\r\n* Ruby: 2.4\r\n"

It does this by changing the environment setup in the specs, so that:\r\n\r\n* HOME and PATH are set early enough so that all specs run with the set values. This also ensures no leaking of files outside of the build directory.\r\n* Where the Aruba runtime is the object under test, it uses the test object when expanding paths.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes the `#cd` method to not clear the entire environment inside the block.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR has been merged we can revisit #434 and concentrate on the cucumber scenarios there."

This is mainly important when checking spec failures by running individual files.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThis is a small part of #434 that hopefully can be merged more quickly so there is a basis for making the final fixes to the specs and then fixing the cucumber scenarios."

So, my testing of this patch was done via running the Cucumber and rspec-core suites instead (which make use of Aruba). Hence, these patches may not be all the places where frozen string literals are being misused, but they're certainly the only places that crop up via either of the other test suites.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\nDepends if you consider supporting frozen string literals a feature or a bug. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for my code\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, the test suite in master wasn't green. Also, my changes don't require new tests (though at some point it'd be nice to have the test suite run in MRI 2.4 with the frozen string literal flag, to avoid regressions)."

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nIncluding Aruba::API in Minitest is not possible because of a conflicing method `run`.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe test as provided under \"Steps to Reproduce\" should run and pass without any assertions, failures, successes or errors.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIt fails with an error, before Minitest even tries to run any tests:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nxxx/gems/aruba-0.14.2/lib/aruba/api/command.rb:140:in `run': Please pass at least a command as first argument. (ArgumentError)\r\n\tfrom xxx/gems/minitest-5.10.1/lib/minitest.rb:822:in `run_one_method'\r\n        .... more backtrace omitted\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nWhen including `Minitest::API` a method `run` is included. Minitest uses a method `run` to run a test. These conflict. The error pasted above is caused because the message signature of `Minitest#run` differs (no arguments) from that of `Aruba`.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\n`Aruba` run could be a class- or instance-method on Aruba. Either `Aruba.run`, `Aruba.api.run` or some such. This way Aruba does not \"pollute\" the test-class when included with a generic `run` method, but instead has it isolated. Alternative would be to name this method `aruba_run`.\r\n\r\nAdding\r\n```\r\n  alias :minitest_run :run\r\n  include Aruba::Api\r\n  alias :aruba_run :run\r\n  alias :run :minitest_run\r\n```\r\nTo the TestClass does not work either, because Aruba uses `run` internally, (e.g. in `run_simple`) which now calls `Minitest#run`. \r\n\r\nThere might be a ruby trick to include methods of a module in a namespace instead, or prefix them with e.g. a `aruba_` on including. I am not familiar with such a trick.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n\r\nUsing the simple test as found below, in e.g. `test/use_aruba_with_minitest.rb`, ran with the command `bundle exec ruby -I test test/use_aruba_with_minitest.rb`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path('../test', __FILE__)\r\n\r\n#require 'test_helper'\r\nrequire 'minitest/autorun'\r\nrequire 'aruba/api'\r\n\r\nclass FirstRun < Minitest::Test\r\n  include Aruba::Api\r\n\r\n  def setup\r\n    aruba_setup\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def test_it_runs_date\r\n    run_simple(\"date\")\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nUsing Aruba in Minitest\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n> ruby -v\r\n>   ruby 2.3.4p301 (2017-03-30 revision 58214) [x86_64-linux]\r\n> aruba (0.14.2)\r\n> minitest 5.10.1\r\n\r\n"

This was broken because the features replaced the default file.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nBuilds were passing even though the cucumbers were failing. This made the Travis CI results effectively useless. Rather than merging in just the PR that makes the build break (#433) , this makes it pass so there is a solid base for future development."

It appears `run interactively` is now functioning as a \"background\" process by default?\r\n\r\nI believe this may be a regression/bug?, since that doesn't appear to be the goal of the behavior from sample Features.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to let an interactive process complete before checking it's exit status, or another mechanism to avoid \"out of order\" problems.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nI've annotated the actual Scenario Outline in my test cases here to illustrate what is happening, see comments inline:\r\n~~~gherkin\r\nScenario Outline: Wrapped `git reset` can handle files with spaces properly\r\n\r\n  Given I am in a git repository\r\n  Given an empty file named \"file with spaces.txt\"\r\n  ###AAA\r\n  Given I successfully run `git add \"file with spaces.txt\"`\r\n\r\n  ###BBB\r\n  Given I run `<shell>` interactively\r\n    And I type `eval \"$(scmpuff init -ws)\"`\r\n    And I type \"scmpuff_status\"\r\n    And I type \"git reset 1\"\r\n    And I type \"echo 'DEBUG: PHASE BBB'\"\r\n    And I type \"exit\"\r\n  Then the exit status should be 0\r\n  ### ^^^ this is now checking exit status of AAA, not BBB!\r\n\r\n  # Then the output should contain \"BBB\"\r\n  ### ^^^ this command however, would force aruba to wait until BBB completes (hacky option #1)\r\n\r\n  # Then I stop the command started last\r\n  ### ^^^ (hacky option #2) also seems to ensure BBB completes, but throws a deprecation error\r\n\r\n  ###CCC\r\n  ### currently, this phase is failing, because it is taking place *BEFORE* BBB completes\r\n  When I run `scmpuff status`\r\n  Then the stdout from \"scmpuff status\" should contain:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    untracked:  [1] file with spaces.txt\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n  Examples:\r\n    | shell |\r\n    | bash  |\r\n    | zsh   |\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI've indicated two possible workarounds in the above code sample comments, but neither seems like it's the intended solution (and one throws a deprecation warning).\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nIn our tests, we need to do some stuff in an interactive shell (as our program modifies the shell environment for end-users as it's primary use case), and follow that up by additional (non-interactive) tests afterwards to check on the state of things.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n* Version used: `0.14.2` and `0.6.2` (pre-regression)\r\n* Operating System and version: tested on both macOS and Linux (travis-ci)\r\n* Link to your project: https://github.com/mroth/scmpuff\r\n"

Its documentation is somewhat cryptic to me (described as steps). I see that there's something called `@announce`, but that didn't do anything for me (and I failed to find documentation that I could use).\r\n\r\nRSpec has that functionality to compare strings built-in. Would it be possible to should pipe that output into RSpec's matches? \r\n\r\nI could try to help with that but I'd need directions because the documentation is unclear to me.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->\r\n<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation.git`\r\n2. `git checkout 235-blueprint-api`\r\n3. `bundle install`\r\n4. Make a one-character change to `features/api_blueprint_documentation.feature`, around lines 260.\r\n5. `bundle exec cucumber features`\r\n\r\nYou will see my screenshot, basically.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\n<!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\r\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\r\nI'm working on a lib that generates documentation automatically based on RSpec tests. The fixture has over 200 lines, so when even one character changes, it's virtually impossible to find out why it's failing, or in other words, what string is different from the expectation.\r\n\r\nThis is making my work very slow. I have to either look by eye or copy paste somewhere else to figure out the diff.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n<!--- If you're reporting a bug, include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n* Version used: 0.13.0 (perhaps it was fixed in 0.14.x?)\r\n* Operating System and version: OSX, El Capitán\r\n* Link to your project: https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation, more specifically (https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation/pull/313/files#diff-0b3146a61839789912f87a2e19beaaa4R244)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    "body": "## Summary\n\nJRuby 9.0.5.0 fails cuke tests where the output contain non-English characters.\n## Details\n\nI tracked this down to an encoding error reported in childprocess when pumping data from the invoked command to the stdout tempfile. My fix is to set the stdout and stderr output files to be in binmode, and then the string matchers for the output declare that the actual result (read from the tempfiles as binary data) is actually UTF-8. This causes no harm in old JRuby or MRI afaict; my cuke tests for my application pass with this fix in place just like they passed before.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nCuke tests for the DataStax Ruby driver failed against jruby 9k, a platform we are trying to support now.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\n<!--- Please add tests for changes to the code, otherwise we probably won't merge it -->\n\nSorry, don't have aruba tests. :(\n\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\n\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\n\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\n\nThe cuke test that failed (there are several that failed the same way, but I focused on this one): https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver/blob/master/features/asynchronous_io/executing_queries.feature#L45-L62\n\nThe error occurred in the \"When it is executed\" part:\nhttps://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-163\n\nFixing SpawnProcess.start got past this error, but the \"Then\" clause started failing with an encoding error. I introduced the force_encoding of actual results in relevant functions to fix that. \n\nI did test that my cuke tests pass on MRI 2.3 and JRuby 1.7.x with these changes, so it doesn't seem like I introduced a regression.\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\n## Types of changes\n\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\n- [X ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ?] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n  I'm not sure if this will break anyone. Changing those matchers to assume 'actual' is utf-8 _might_ be overzealous.\n## Checklist:\n\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\n\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! -->\n- [ ] I've added tests for my code\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n"

It should probably be `support/`, ie, a subdirectory under \n## Possible Solution\n\nReplace the documented code and generated code with something like:\n\n```\n::Dir.glob(::File.expand_path('support/**/*.rb',File.dirname(__FILE__))).each { |f| require_relative f }\n```\n## Motivation\n\nFor a mixed style project -- which includes CLI and non-cli examples, it's desirable to separate the testing categeories. So in `spec/spec_helper.rb` I have:\n\n```\nrequire `spec/spec_helper_cli.rb`\n```\n\nAnd in that file, I have the `::Dir.glob....` code. This way I can do:\n\n```\nrspec spec/spec_helper_cli.rb\n```\n\nto test only the CLI related stuff.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nWhen using the `and I wait for the output to contain \"abc\"` step, the output fetcher tries to wait for the process to exit, which times out when the process is prompting for input. \n## Expected Behavior\n\nHere's a test case:\n\n```\nFeature: interactive\n  Scenario: running a native binary interactively with multiple prompts\n    Given the file named \"bin/ask\" with:\n    \"\"\"\n    #!/bin/bash\n    echo -n \"What is your name? \"\n    read name\n    echo $name\n    echo -n \"What is your favorite beer style? \"\n    read beer\n    echo $beer\n    echo \"Hello $name. I like $beer too! Your round!\"\n    \"\"\"\n    When I run `bash bin/ask` interactively\n    And I wait for output to contain \"name\"\n    And I type \"mdma\"\n    And I wait for output to contain \"beer\"\n    And I type \"Belgian Trippel\"\n    Then the output should contain:\n    \"\"\"\n    What is your name? mdma\n    What is your favorite beer style? Belgian Trippel\n    Hello mdma. I like Belgian Trippel too! Your round!\n    \"\"\"\n```\n## Current Behavior\n\nWhen running this, the first `wait for output` step hangs waiting for the process to exit, which it never does, since the process is waiting for input that's provided by the next step. \n## Possible Solution\n\nMy quick workaround was to remove the call to stop the process as part of the `have_output` matcher.  https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/blob/master/lib/aruba/matchers/command/have_output.rb#L18-L22\n\nAfter doing that, the have_output matcher does exit, which then raised a secondary issue in the step definition - `undefined constant ExpectationError` at https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/blob/master/lib/aruba/cucumber/command.rb#L126\n\nI changed that to `rescue RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError` and the test above worked.\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n\nPlease run the test above. You'll see it times out after a few seconds with\n\n```\nTimeout::Error: execution expired\n./features/interactive.feature:15:in `And I wait for output to contain \"name\"'\n```\n## Context & Motivation\n\nI am testing a CLI program that prompts the user for information, but currently this doesn't work because the process is expected to exit.\n## Your Environment\n- Version used: 0.14.1\n- Operating System and version: OS X Yosemite\n- Link to your project: https://github.com/spark/particle-cli\n"

This is a javascript library which is bundled into a ruby gem. The gem modifies the content of some nodejs environment variables which are required to be modified so that, \"stylus\" get be found.\n\n<!--- Provide a general summary description of the issue -->\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe \"stylus\"-gem should work with aruba.\n\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\n<!--- Feel free to use Given / Then / Then if that helps, but please add some plain-language context too -->\n## Current Behavior\n\nThe content of the environment variables gets lost because of aruba's isolation mechanism for environment variables.\n\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\n<!--- If you have got some output place it in the code block below.

Some tests will fail.

If some doesn't fit, skip them. In general: Please provide as much information as you can to help us solving your problem -->\n\n<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\n## Current Situation\n\nWe now support integration into `cucumber`, `rspec` and `minitest`. At least for the first two ones we would normally define dependencies on \"gem\"-level. Today we only require `cucumber` to be installed. This is not required by users using `aruba` with `rspec` only.\n\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\n<!--- If you have got some output place it in the code block below. Otherwise remove it. -->\n\n```\n```\n## Possible Solution\n1. Create a gem `aruba` with dependencies to:\n   - aruba-cucumber\n   - aruba-rspec\n   - aruba-core\n   \n   This gem only includes the executable `aruba`. Otherwise bundler will complain or we rename it to `aruba-cli` and put it into a separate gem as well.\n2. Create a gem `aruba-cucumber` with dependencies to:\n   - aruba-core\n   - cucumber\n3. Create a gem `aruba-rspec` with dependencies to:\n   - aruba-core\n   - rspec\n4. Create a gem `aruba-core` with the rest of the dependencies of the current `aruba`-gem.\n5. Maybe: Create a gem `aruba-cli` which only contains cli-commands for `aruba`.\n# Open Questions\n- [ ] It makes sense to do this\n- [ ] Shall we have separate repositories or place everything in a single repository\n- [ ] `aruba-rspec` is already used by another gem which seems to be unmaintained since 2014.\n\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n## Benefits\n\nUsers only have depencies installed they really need.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nI am using Aruba with Cucumber to test a command line tool that generates code. In most of my features, I need to call Aruba step definitions from within my own step definitions. Although the Aruba steps work fine when not called from another step def, when I do call an Aruba step from inside another step def, the expectations will not fail. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or expected behavior, so I wanted to check before working on a PR. \n## Expected Behavior\n\nIn many of my test files, I am using steps like this:\n\n``` cucumber\nGiven a file named \"foo.raml\" with:\n  \"\"\"\n  #% RAML 0.8\n  ---\n  # generated code\n  \"\"\"\nWhen I run `rambo foo.raml`\nThen there should be a file named \"foo_spec.rb\" with:\n  \"\"\"\n  describe Foo do\n    # generated code\n  end\n  \"\"\"\n```\n\nThese steps do work as expected. However, it becomes cumbersome to include long content as a docstring, so I would like to write steps like this:\n\n``` cucumber\nGiven a file named \"foo.raml\" like \"basic_raml.raml\"\nWhen I run `rambo foo.raml`\nThen the file \"foo_spec.rb\" should be like \"basic_raml_spec.rb.example\"\n```\n\nThis step then has the following definition:\n\n``` ruby\nGiven(/^a file named \"([^\"]*)\" like \"([^\"]*)\"$/) do |file, example|\n  # The read_example method finds a file named basic_raml.raml in the \n  # /features/support/examples directory and reads from that file.\n  text = read_example(example)\n  steps %Q{\n    Given a file named \"#{file}\" with:\n      \"\"\"\n      #{text}\n      \"\"\"\n  }\nend\n\nThen(/^the file \"([^\"]*)\" should be like \"([^\"]*)\"$/) do |file, example|\n  text = read_example(example)\n  steps %Q{\n    the file \"#{file}\" should contain:\n      \"\"\"\n      #{text}\n      \"\"\"\n  }\nend\n```\n\nMy expectation is that this scenario behave the same as the one using the Aruba-defined steps only. In other words, it should pass if the contents of the output file match those of the example file and fail if they do not.\n## Current Behavior\n\nInstead of failing when the contents of the output file do not match those of the example file, the steps that call the Aruba definitions pass regardless of the contents of the output file. (They will fail if the example files don't exist.) Inspecting the contents of the `tmp/aruba` directory confirms that the steps are passing whether the output matches the example or not. \n## Context\n\nThis issue is making it very difficult to test this tool with Cucumber, and has resulted in my accepting pull requests that broke the code without realizing it. Although I'm willing to dig into this and make a pull request, I mostly wanted to confirm that this was a bug and not an expected behavior before I did so.\n## Your Environment\n- Version used: 0.14.1\n- Cucumber version used: 2.3.3\n- Operating System and version: OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite\n- Link to your project: https://github.com/danascheider/rambo\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nCurrently, Aruba uses the host's resources for isolating (environment setting, tmp folder) while instead, all this can be done inside a Docker container or VM.\n\nGiven Aruba's existing API, it should be transparent whether commands are run on a host OS or inside a VM/container. E.g. `write_file`, `chmod` would all be executed within the \"current\" Docker container.\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIdeally, I should be able to set the \"platform\" to \"Docker\" (or something similar) so that all Aruba API commands would be Docker-aware.\n\nE.g. `set_environment_variable` would simply pass the variables to the container running the command. A Cucumber's Background scenario would commit an intermediate docker container image - which could be reused by other scenarios. The `working_directory` feature would map to Docker's `working_directory`.\n\nIn fact, most of Docker's Dockerfile commands already can be mapped logically to most of Aruba's API.\n## Current Behavior\n\nCurrently, Aruba doesn't allow any integration - it gets in the way more than it helps. E.g. ChildProcess cannot be replaced easily with something like `docker-api` (which provides a lot of similar functionality).\n\nThere are also not enough \"hooks\" to \"add\" such integration - there would be too much monkey-patching.\n## Possible Solution\n\nMostly, the existing API would have to be redesigned for more flexibility and abstraction. This is a good thing, because the outcome would really put the current architecture to the test.\n\nJust \"wrapping\" calls inside Cucumber steps isn't enough - Aruba has to internally be able to fully communicate with Docker via the Docker API.\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n1. Take an existing Aruba project\n2. Try to make the environment setup and commands run flawlessly from within a Docker container\n\nThere could be a separate `aruba-docker` project, but it doesn't make sense to develop it until Aruba can actually use such an extension first.\n## Context\n\nIn general, docker support would allow full-isolation without the current downsides of Aruba/Cucumber, which are:\n1. Very slow tests (Docker calls can be really fast since very Background scenario can be cached)\n2. Host OS needs to be setup for isolation (While you can set up the guest OS/container without any changes on the host OS)\n3. Host OS environment has to be cleared (while inside docker there's a \"blank slate\", e.g. you can have no dependencies installed)\n4. Parallel running is tricky (while all docker containers are independent by design)\n5. General \"dislike\" for specialized \"clean room\" features, such as RVM support (while inside docker you can just put the OS in any state you want without much effort)\n6. No tools for debugging failures (while Docker has lots of feature that can help - e.g. history of commands, snapshots, diffs, tar snapshots, attaching to running containers, etc.)\n7. Inconveniences using files from the source tree (while Docker can either copy or use the workspace inside a container)\n8. No first-class support for fixtures (while in Docker, a container pretty much IS a fixture).\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nAccording to the README.md, Aruba is designed \"to make testing of command-line applications meaningful, easy and fun.\"\n\nDoes that include testing the **installation process** of command-line applications?\n\nIt is unclear whether that's within or beyond the scope of Aruba.\n## Expected Behavior\n\nReal life example: `tmuxinator` is a command-line tool packaged as a gem. Due to a recent RubyGems bug, it fails to install correctly. Basically, a symlink to the tool (`bin/mux`) is installed incorrectly, thus making it useless.\n\nThe only way to \"catch\" this bug is to: install the gem in an isolated environment and test it there.\n\nI'd expect it to be clear whether this is an \"exception\" to what Aruba's README says or a \"missing feature\".\n## Current Behavior\n\nAruba provides literally no support for testing tool installation in isolated environments. And current release plans suggest there never will be any such support included in Aruba.\n## Possible Solution\n\nAt least clarify in the README whether a lack of such support is intended or if it's a \"bug\" or \"omission\".\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n\nTry to create an Aruba test for testing `tmuxinator` after installation using the newest RubyGems from Ruby 2.3.0. \n\nBasically, this would mean a Cucumber scenario:\n1. Installing `tmuxinator` from current sources (something currently not supported by Aruba)\n2. Running the `mux` command and checking it's output\n\nThere is simply no example of how to achieve the first.\n## Context\n\nWithout Aruba support, the only other options to test things like the `tmuxinator` `mux` command are:\n1. Manually (by installing the gem and testing it) - which is no fun\n2. Designing custom steps for this, even though they are the same for every single \"tool gem\" out there (which is no fun either)\n\nSo something Aruba promises to be fun is currently not fun at all.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nWhen stderr+stdout announcing is enabled for `run_simple` in RSpec, both announcements are duplicated.\n\nE.g. if a cli command outputs \"hello world\" in STDOUT, you'll see:\n\n```\n<<-STDOUT\nhello world\nSTDOUT\n\n<<-STDOUT\nhello world\nSTDOUT\n```\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIf the command is only run once, it should print each stderr/stdout announcement only once.\n## Current Behavior\n\nCurrently, the `stop()` call in `run_simple()` sends the notifications to announce the process's stderr+stdout. Then, `stop_all_commands` does the same.\n## Possible Solution\n\nThe sanest \"workaround\" for now is: just temporarily disable announcing during the `stop` in run_simple. Since the output is gathered when the process ends anyway, this isn't a problem.\n\nI implemented this in my own fork here:\n\nhttps://github.com/e2/aruba/commit/c540485da24c71c1ad6fc3960b6211175e169943\n\nIdeally, there should be a way to \"consume\" stderr/stdout during announcements. And ideally there would be a \"streaming\" of stderr/stdout live while the app is running.\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n1. Aruba + RSpec\n2. Activate announcing for `stdout`\n3. `run_simple` with a simple 'hello world' script\n4. You'll have the announcement appear twice (once for `stop` inside `run_simple`, and once for `stop_all_commands` when the test is done)\n## Context\n\nI want to see the output of commands - and it's annoying to get errors showing up multiple times on the screen. Especially annoying is having two sets of stdout+stderr. No to mention it's very confusing. (At first I though somehow the test ran twice).\n## Your Environment\n\nProject without cucumber (RSpec only, standard setup with `aruba init --test-framework=rspec`).\n"

(I prefer to have broken compatibility rather then getting hundreds of deprecation warnings with no backtraces. And I just can't wait weeks/months for my PRs to be considered).\n## Motivation and Context\n\nFor release 1.x. Until my PRs here are dealt with, I'm switching to working on this fork from now on.\n\nI decided that if I have to juggle branches while I wait weeks for PRs to be pulled in here (I get it, we're all busy!) ... I'll just work off my own fork. Just to avoid the \"bottleneck\" here.\n\nIf you want PRs from this, just ask for them - but please deal with my existing PRs first.\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nGreen on local Docker. (cucumber + rspec).\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\n## Types of changes\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [X] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n## Checklist:\n- [X] My code follows the code style of this project.\n- [X] My change requires a change to the documentation.\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nIt isn't clear anywhere how `run` and `run_simple` are different.\n## Expected Behavior\n\nI'd expect the different to be clearly documented somewhere.\n## Current Behavior\n\nCurrently, `run_simple` is used in Cucumber steps. Technically, RSpec users should usually use `run_simple` unless they want to run something interactively. (`run_interactively` used to be more intuitive).\n## Possible Solution\n\nIdeally rename `run` to `run_in_background` (or something as suggestive) and rename `run_simple` to `run_and_wait` to at least avoid confusing the two methods. I'd actually make `run` work like `run_simple` does now - if people mistakenly try to \"interact\", they'll get an error anyway.\n## Context\n\nAccidentally using `run` for a simple script produces no output. The results can't be more confusing: no output, nothing announced, no errors. And you really have to dig deep into the api to find out you called `run` instead of `run_simple`. The docs on both methods don't even clear up the confusion. The only meaningful \"difference\" is that `run_simple` calls `command.stop`.\n\nThat's as insanely \"non-intuitive\" as you can get.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nYou can do `Kernel.system(\"ruby\", \"hello.rb\")` but in Aruba you cannot do `run(\"ruby\", \"hello.rb\")`.\n\n(Also, doing so crashes ChildProcess because \"hello.rb\" is passed as a string for the `:timeout` parameter, which may confuse/discourage users).\n## Expected Behavior\n\nI'd expect `run` to work more like `Kernel.system`. Almost related \"command running\" call in Ruby accepts arguments as method parameters. Also, usually, the first hash is the environment (which can probably be ignored here due to environment setting api) and the last is a hash with options. (Which is how Aruba should expect options for `run` to be passed).\n## Current Behavior\n\n`run(\"ruby\", \"hello.rb\")` crashes (on latest released stable) and definitely doesn't do what Ruby programmers would intuitively expect.\n## Possible Solution\n\nAllow command arguments to be passed as an array - just like every developer would expect. Otherwise, the crash is confusing and only more \"advanced\" users correctly remember to use `Shellwords` to join arguments safely. And it's clumsy to do it manually.\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n\nUse `run(\"ruby\", \"hello.rb\")` to crash Aruba with a confusing error.\n## Context\n\nAs a Ruby developer, I'd expect `run` to work much like `Kernel.system` or `popen`, etc.\n## Your Environment\n\nLatest stable Aruba. (0.14.1).\n"

If that's an issue, it's best to switch master to 1.x, branch off 0.14 for backporting, and just focus on releasing 1.x ASAP. It's no problem to then work on 2.x a month from now - no one will complain because of \"too many major releases\". Aruba is complex, so learning is expected. And if learning is reflected in \"multiple major releases\", that's just an indication of how much learning (or rework) was needed, nothing else. I'm guessing it's actually more useful to just skip to 2.x (master - without releasing), branch off 1.x as unreleased as \"work in progress\" (too keep the branches). E.g. I'm (as a contributor) only interested in master and not backward compatibility or deprecations - so it makes no sense to add an artificial \"burden\" on master. You can always work on a \"transition release\" - but only if there's a genuine need in the community. Master branch should be optimized for quickly accepting PRs. (If PRs don't have priority over other work, contributing feels very discouraging - as if there's a ton of \"bureaucracy\"). It doesn't make sense to expect contributors to make backports of their own fixes (that they don't need themselves).\n\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n## Current Behavior\n\nIt takes a long time to release a major release.\n\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n## Possible Solution\n\nRelease faster.\n\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\n\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nNew contributors need a sense of \"direction\" to know what to expect when working on the current Aruba codebase.\n## Expected Behavior\n\nNormally, when I want to contribute to a project I \"expect\":\n1. Master to be pretty much stable and usable (or clearly explained why if not)\n2. All tests to pass locally (or clearly explained why if not)\n3. High coverage (or clearly explained why if not)\n4. Stable major releases (or clearly explained why that hasn't happened)\n5. ETAs for milestones, releases and major rework (just to get a sense of how long \"wait\" if needed)\n6. A sense of how \"busy\" things are at any given time (to decide if I should help with major work or if too many people will get in each other's way)\n7. Low friction to contributing (or good explanations why to follow conventions to the letter)\n8. A general sense of the project (to know whether to report stuff that isn't working or just \"wait\" for rework to finish first and stable releases to be published)\n9. Whether maintainers are invited to apply or not\n10. A general \"roadmap\" to align any contributions I'd make (or just drop them without starting - to avoid wasted time on feature that may no longer make sense)\n11. etc...\n## Current Behavior\n\nThe biggest pain points I've had are:\n1. Waiting ages for \"dependent commits\" to fix a pressing issue for me (RVM support)\n2. Lots of \"work in progress\" without guidance on how to help push things forward\n3. Lots of constant and new deprecations before even reaching 1.x\n4. No 1.x for over a year.\n5. Deprecations messages were more a bother than useful (it would be easier to just have \"recommended\" documentation on how to do things instead.\n6. Aruba still uses it's own deprecations in multiple place.\n7. Not enough coverage and constantly changing internal+external API's\n8. Reading History.md is not a good way to learn what changed, since I'm already confused what is deprecated and what isn't. (And when something is, I have a hard time to understand what to do instead and especially what's \"available\").\n9. I'd actually prefer crashes rather than deprecations.\n10. Ruby 1.8 not dropped and purged from the codebase (wasted time I'll never get back).\n11. With all the deprecations, moving around the codebase is a bit discouraging.\n12. Hard to work out how to effectively debug and \"get stuff done\" with Aruba - I can never remember (or find the docs) on how to enable announcing, how to set in-process Aruba, how to set/unset variables, how to capture stderr/stdout for a given process, whether to use \"run\" or \"run_simple\", how to set things up with RSpec (config, hooks), how to actually track the execution and what's going on \"under the hood\" (especially when most errors are \"silent\" or \"output wasn't matched\").\n13. There's \"so much\" API for managing processes, I can't seem to figure out what the flow is (to debug an issue - or simply to just understand what I'm doing wrong).\n## Possible Solution\n\nAgain, general \"info\" about the project would help. Status, plans, ongoing work, etc. If I \"step in\" only to have to wait about a year for \"other parts of the codebase to get sorted out first\" - and then I find that over the year there's still no 1.x ... and while being spammed with deprecations that don't really tell me enough to know what's available (or at least hint _why_ something was deprecated so I could intuitively \"guess\" what could work instead ... all this is a bit discouraging, even if there are valid/sound/understandable reasons behind everything going on.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nImplement `ArubaPath#blocks` by guessing when it's not available for a given filesystem.\n\nNOTE: If the block size cannot be determined, a default of 4096 is used. (I'm aware this is different from the default of `Aruba.config.physical_block_size`, which has a default of 512 - I believe it should be 4096).\n## Details\n\nThe formula is basically asking \"how many blocks are needed to at least fit the file's size?\".\n\nA spec was added to test various edge values.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nIf `File::Stat.blocks` is nil, guessing is a better option than nothing.\n\nAlso, \"disk usage\" based on \"blocks reported by stat()\" is unreliable because of filesystem metadata and things like compression/deduplication (e.g. BTRFS).\n\nSo since disk usage is a \"guess\" at best anyway, I implemented this by calculating the blocks based on the file size. Primitive filesystems (e.g FAT) are likely more conservative with blocks, so it seems reasonable.\n\nAnd there are network filesystem where we'll \"never know\" anyway.\n\nFuther more, network filesystems won't even tell you what the `blksize` is, so that has to be \"guessed\" too.\n\nI assumed: 4096 bytes. This seems reasonable because:\n1. Only exotic filesystems and ones with custom settings have different values.\n2. It's a sane balance between many small files and losing too much disk space.\n3. Most Windows filesystems (where it's the usually case where values aren't available) usually defaults to 4k anyway\n4. People likely aren't going to be using Aruba for calculating disk space on humongous filesystems\n5. Most large-blocked local filesystems usually will likely be advanced enough to provide the info available anyway\n6. Systems with smaller block sizes will be \"overestimated\", which is still a good thing. This doesn't matter much, because either the usage will exceed the device size (or be close), so people will notice ... or ... for lots of large files filling up the media, the total \"margin of error\" will be small.\n7. Even mission-critical systems aren't likely going to rely on disk usage, which is to error-prone in theory alone.\n\nSo I see no downside. \n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nSpecs added and they pass (locally). File::Stat is mocked, so whatever my own filesystem reports is irrelevant. \n## Types of changes\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n\n(The \"guessing\" could be unexpected, but assuming disk usage measurement can be accurate is ... incorrect anyway).\n## Checklist:\n- [X] My code follows the code style of this project.\n- [X] My change requires a change to the documentation.\n- [X] Documentation has been updated\n"

This makes Ruby 1.8.7 just too ancient to work with. E.g. I can't even install 1.8.7 without bending over backwards (because building 1.8.7 requires another ruby present, older versions of libraries). Pretty much the only place where 1.8.7 used nowadays is on Travis, etc.\n\nRemoving this would make contributing much easier, especially without the need to go back-and-forth with forgotten old-style hashes (`:a => :b` vs `a: :b`).\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nGreen on Travis. (Running tests on master locally still means lots of issues).\n## Types of changes\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n\n(Bug, since Ruby 1.8.7 is difficult to install and there's not official support to change that).\n## Checklist:\n- [X] My code follows the code style of this project.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nAllows locally running test in a fully-provisioned Docker container.\n## Details\n\nAdded `script/run_tests_in_docker` which should pretty much do everything out of the box, including:\n1. Building the image from scratch (ideally, the Aruba team should provide a base image for this on http://hub.docker.io, so people can just quickly download what they need).\n2. Docker Compose file for automating the setup\n3. Example .gemrc file for caching gems\n4. Optimized for reruns (gems are smartly cached before testing starts - by copying the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to \"pre-bundle\" with needed gems)\n5. Automatically works when Dockerfile is changed (so users can just add packages/steps there and then just rerun the tests).\n6. RVM is included and ready (with MRI 2.3.0 as default), so developers can easily switch to e.g. JRuby before rerunning tests.\n\nAlso, I updated the bootstrap script:\n1. Refactored.\n2. Logging to temp file (explained in commit)\n3. More dependencies (Python and JDK)\n## Motivation and Context\n\nThis mostly avoids any and every issue caused by custom environments on a typical desktop. (E.g. locale, shell configuration, app versions, missing requirements before tests start, failures on travis, multiple Ruby versions, etc).\n\nAnd it's just as fast as on the host, so it makes little sense not to use it. (Except maybe disk space on laptops with tiny SSD drives).\n\nThis is why I marked using Docker for tests as \"recommended\" in CONTRIBUTING.md.\n\nThere's no downside, especially since now Windows users can quickly tests their development tree in a Docker container (via a VM, but still much faster and convenient that through a PR+Travis).\n\n(It may even be possible to transparently run tests in Windows - e.g. run a silent install of Ruby inside a Wine docker image - or maybe even on Windows containers, but that's beyond my interests).\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nShould work on any Linux system with Docker and Docker Compose installed.\n\nEnvironment should more or less resemble that of Travis. If not, any future differences can be easily accounted for in the Dockerfile.\n## Types of changes\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n## Checklist:\n- [X] My code follows the code style of this project.\n- [X] My change requires a change to the documentation.\n- [X] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n"

    "body": "## Summary\n\nRemove all code, checks and RuboCop enabling/disabling for specifics related to Ruby < 1.9.2.\n## Motivation and Context\n\nRuby 1.9.3 has been EOL for almost a year, so ideally users should move to Ruby 2.x. This makes Ruby 1.8.7 just too ancient to work with. E.g. I can't even install 1.8.7 without bending over backwards (because building 1.8.7 requires another ruby present, older versions of libraries). Pretty much the only place where 1.8.7 used nowadays is on Travis, etc.\n\nRemoving this would make contributing much easier, especially without the need to go back-and-forth with forgotten old-style hashes (`:a => :b` vs `a: :b`).\n## How Has This Been Tested?\n\nGreen on Travis. (Running tests on master locally still means lots of issues).\n## Types of changes\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n\n(Bug, since Ruby 1.8.7 is difficult to install and there's not official support to change that).\n## Checklist:\n- [X] My code follows the code style of this project.\n"

And that's EOL also. So it's detrimental to go back and forth to tweak PRs just so the integration builds are green. (Also, hashes are just a PITA).\n\nAlso, Aruba 1.x hasn't been release, and 1.9.3 has been EOL for over a year.\n\nAnd since the differences between 1.9.3 and 2.0 aren't that horrific, the master branch may as well just assume Ruby 2.0.

    "body": "Hi,\n\nPerhaps this isn't the right venue for this, but I'm attempting to package `aruba` for the GNU Guix package manager, and `aruba` requires `event-bus`. I can download the `event-bus` gem from rubygems without issue, but I am wondering where the source code for this gem is located. The URL listed at rubygems is https://github.com/cucumber/event-bus but this repository 404s for me.\n\nIt appears that the `features` and `spec` directories are missing from the gem making testing event-bus from the contents of the gem impossible.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThanks,\nben\n"

There are two scenarios. The first \"Running ruby interactively\" is your example that works (it defines the cli and the test inside itself) and the second \"Running real cli interactively\" is mine with which I have the problem. When you run `bundle exec cucumber` you see that the execution waits for input. However if you comment (in env.rb):\n\n``` ruby\nAruba.configure do |config|\n  config.command_launcher = :in_process\n  config.main_class = Problem::Runner\nend\n```\n\nyou can run \"Running real cli interactively\" test without any problem.\n"

    "body": "There are a number of places in the RSpec tests that are specific to a unix system and will fail on Windows because Windows doesn't implement that feature.  Instead of trying to come up with tests that will satisfy both Windows and \"not Windows\" operating systems, we should do what RSpec does with its testing:  use **conditional filters**.  \nWe could define some constant in `spec_helper.rb` that will tell us if the system is running on a Windows OS, like `WINDOWS = FFI::Platform.windows?`.  Then we can use `:unless => WINDOWS` to run specs that should only be run on non-Windows systems, and `if => WINDOWS` to run the test that should only be run on a Windows system.  \n\nHere's an example of how it can be used:  \n\n``` ruby\n# in spec_helper.rb:\nWINDOWS = FFI::Platform.windows?\n```\n\n``` ruby\n# in spec\\aruba\\aruba_path_spec:\n\n  describe '#blocks', :unless => WINDOWS do  \n    let(:new_path) { expand_path('path/to/file') }\n\n    before(:each) { FileUtils.mkdir_p File.dirname(new_path) }\n    before(:each) { File.open(new_path, 'w') { |f| f.print 'a' } }\n\n    it { expect(path.blocks).to be > 0 }\n  end\n```\n\nThe above example group will fail on Windows, because `.blocks` will always return `nil` since it's not implemented on Windows.  \nThere are quite a number of tests that will need this.  _File permissions_ is one area where there will need to be different tests for sure.  There may be some other file or directory related tests where this is needed.  \n\nWhat do you think of using this approach?\n"

When trying to use the `Then the output should contain: ....` assertion, my tests pass locally however I get no output on my Travis CI builds.  Of the two child processes one of them is a javascript CLI and the other is a php CLI.  For my failing assertions, one of them is related to output not showing up from the javascript process and the other three are from the php process. On the php side I have modified my php.ini settings to not buffer stdout using:\n\n``` php\nini_set('implicit_flush', 'on');\nini_set('output_buffering', 'off');\n```\n\nand also when printing to stdout:\n\n``` php\nfprintf(STDOUT, \"Text to print\");\nflush()\n```\n\nSo my output on the php side should not have any issues but it continues to fail.  The javascript process is an open source project that I have not written myself.  It prints the data to stdout by use of `console.log(data);`\n\nThe other interesting thing is I also run PHPUnit tests after my cucumber tests that check for output and those run just fine.  So I am unsure if this is an aruba/cucumber problem or something with my php or javascript cli program but I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction and would greatly appreciate any help.\n\nHere is the travis [ci build](https://travis-ci.org/ddelnano/dredd-hooks-php) and the [github repo](https://github.com/ddelnano/dredd-hooks-php) of the code.\n"

Now they also need to wrap their code within `aruba_scope {}`.\n\nOutstanding: Real World Test with `middleman` (middleman/middleman#1562) if this really works.\n\nThis PR also includes some fixes, we need to merge separately if this PR does not solve the problem at all and is therefor dropped.\n"

    "body": "Windows treats its environment variables without regard to the CASE. That is, in Windows, the environment variable <code>'PATH' == 'Path' == 'PaTh' == 'patH'</code> etc.  Using <code>ENV</code> to query the environment variables from Windows is also case-insensitive.  So: <code>ENV['PATH'] == ENV['Path']</code>\n\nHowever, once that information is brought into Ruby (e.g. by something like <code>environment = ENV.to_hash</code>, then case matters.  In this case, the keys in <code>environment</code> _are_ case sensitive.  So <code>environment['PATH'] </code> is _not_ equal to <code>environment['Path']</code>\n\nThis is causing failure anywhere that ENV['PATH'] is used.  (Specs and features that depend on this all fail under Windows.)  ENV['Path'] = _<the actual path information, according to Windows>_ is what is copied into <code>@environment</code>  But the key used is still 'Path' (mixed case).  But in the rest of the code, the key 'PATH' is used.  Since nothing exists for that key, things don't happen like they should.\n\nI suggest that the use of ENV['PATH'] be isolated (turned in to a method call).  Then any initial case conversion can be done privately (e.g. change things to upper case before any comparison is done with ENV['PATH']).  \nI'm not sure where such a method should go.  (I haven't explored it.)  \n"

The following code works for me:\n\n```\ndef run!\n        @process = ChildProcess.build(*Shellwords.split(@cmd))\n\n        # Windows needs to prepend commands with 'cmd.exe /c' @see from https://github.com/jarib/childprocess/issues/59\n        @process = ChildProcess.build(*(Shellwords.split(@cmd).unshift(\"cmd.exe\", \"/c\"))) if ChildProcess.windows?\n\n```\n\nWould you like a PR for this?\n"

It seems odd to drop support for a ruby version in 2.1, given that it's not SemVer compliant at all and the current version is 0.7.\n\nBTW, I don't see a github tag for the 0.7.x release which makes it hard to navigate to them.

Seems to be doable and reasonable. What do you think?\n\nReferences: cucumber/cucumber#839, cucumber/cucumber#851\n"

By using `values_match?` there's no need to treat the regexp, string or any other case as special.\n\nDocs:\n\nhttp://rspec.info/documentation/3.2/rspec-expectations/RSpec/Matchers/Composable.html#values_match%3F-instance_method\n\nhttp://rspec.info/documentation/3.2/rspec-expectations/RSpec/Matchers/Composable.html#description_of-instance_method\n\nBear in mind that this will only work on RSpec 3+.

I think it needs to be discussed first. All \"old\" tests are passing with this code. It also duplicates the `capture`-method I used in some other PR. I only added it to make the tests pass. The documentation is not complete. Tests needs to be written.\n\nBesides that I'm quite happy with the code:\n- It support's the old API and adds a lot of deprecation warnings\n- Now all announcer code is bundled and has a nice API which be extended easily by us and by users - see a very first version of an example in `lib/aruba/announcer.rb`\n- The `announce_or_puts`-method is gone and replaced by `mode=`\n- I introduced a `default_announcer` which writes to `/dev/null` and an announcer which writes to what ever announcer was chosen by `mode=` - e.g. `Kernel.puts`, `puts`\n- At first I thought it might be a good idea to store the activated announcers in a `Hash`, but decided against it because we would end up with different activated `Announcers` if the mode is changed between two activations\n- All process monitoring code is bundled in `ProcessMonitor` - BTW I'm open to rename if one of you guys has a better idea.\n\n@jarl-dk @mattwynne \n\nSuggestions?\n"

Please join the mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cukes-devs and we'll welcome you there!\n\nWe could try to arrange a Google Hangout for you, Jarl and I to discuss our ideas for Aruba.

What do you think?\n\nTo make it possible to use `expand_path` everywhere I removed the `prep_for_fs`-call, because otherwise we would have doubled the `tmp/aruba`-path in the expanded path.\n\nDo you see any reason to keep the method as part of `aruba`. I mark it as deprecated.\n\nI added single commits for the changes to make review easier. I will squash them after the review.\n\nI also added a spec for the `absolute_path` as long as it is part of `aruba`. The deprecation warning is silenced.\n"

    "body": "Hi @jarl-dk  @mattwynne ,\n\nI would like to discuss the following things with you:\n1. Move \"Helper\"-methods to `aruba/helpers.rb` - e.g. `absolute_path`\n2. Move internal helpers to `aruba/utils.rb` and make them `module`-functions of `Aruba::Utils`\n   \n   '1.' and '2.' will make clear, what is part of the `aruba`-API\n3. Migrate `check_*`-methods to `rspec`-matchers\n4. Migrate `assert*`-methods to `rspec`-matchers\n   \n   '3.' and '4.' will make tests more readable + providing better error methods\n   to users. And will make use of all the good things which come with\n   `expect(x)`. And as we are already using `rspec` for the api-tests,\n   testing of the new `matchers` will be dead simple.\n   \n   Alternative: Create more custom matchers to improve code.\n   \n   _Example_:\n   \n   **old**\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   def check_file_size(paths_and_sizes)\n    prep_for_fs_check do\n      paths_and_sizes.each do |path, size|\n        path = File.expand_path(path)\n        expect(File.size(path)).to eq size\n      end\n    end\n   end\n   ```\n   \n   **new**\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   def check_file_size(paths_and_sizes)\n    prep_for_fs_check do\n      paths_and_sizes.each do |path, size|\n        path = File.expand_path(path)\n        expect(path).to have_file_size size\n      end\n    end\n   end\n   ```\n   \n   Writing `rspec` tests using the `assert_*` looks very weird. I would prefer\n   to have custom `rspec`-matchers for this.\n   \n   **old**\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   def assert_partial_output(expected, actual)\n    actual.force_encoding(expected.encoding) if RUBY_VERSION >= \"1.9\"\n    expect(unescape(actual)).to include(unescape(expected))\n   end\n   ```\n   \n   **new**\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   def assert_partial_output(expected, actual)\n   $stderr.puts 'Deprecated'\n    expect(actual).to include_content expected\n   end\n   \n   # matcher\n   RSpec::Matchers.define :include_content do |expected|\n    match do |actual|\n      actual.force_encoding(expected.encoding) if RUBY_VERSION >= \"1.9\"\n   \n      # Support real files as well\n      actual = File.read(absolute_path(actual.to_s)).chomp if actual.is_a? Pathname\n      Aruba::Utils.unescape(actual).include?

The 0.6.2 aruba release from a couple days ago broke our build:\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/rspec/rspec-core/jobs/47020617#L303\n\nWe (perhaps wrongly) assumed `regexp` was a public API since it wasn't labeled `@private`.  Would you consider adding it back and making it a public API? Otherwise we can work around it (which is fine).\n\nAlso, can you clarify what your API/versioning policy is?  Do you aim to follow the SemVer.org spec?  If so, what APIs do you consider public (and therefore subject to the SemVer.org spec)?  I'd like to make sure we're limiting what we use to just your public APIs so we don't run into this kind of thing again.\n"

    "body": "This PR adds the basics to support fixtures in `aruba`. Also see  #219.\n\nThings to discuss:\n- [ ] Use of `OpenStruct`\n  \n  I used `OpenStruct` here to make both paths of a fixture available: The relative one which is used to find a fixture and the absolute one, which can be used by a `consumer` of the api like `copy_file`. I can replace this by a `Hash` if this is preferred. Though `OpenStruct` is part of `ruby core distribution`.\n- [ ] Use of `Pathname`\n  \n  I like the `relative_path_from`-functionality of `Pathname`. It makes the intention of the author clear and is quite easy to use to build relative paths.\n- [ ] Use of `%/` as fixture path prefix\n  \n  It does not have a special meaning in ruby so far - besides percent classes which are not followed by `/`.\n- [ ] Order of directories to be searched\n  \n  I use \"my\" preferred order here, but I'm open to change it.\n- [ ] Commit Style\n  \n  I will refactor the \"commits\" after all things above are discussed to make sure that there's one commit for the tests and one commit for the implementation.\n- [ ] Rubocop\n  \n  I think we will need to \"guard\" this [line](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/pull/224/files#diff-65af44ccc0b346dd91178a015aee5560R39) and that [line](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/pull/224/files#diff-65af44ccc0b346dd91178a015aee5560R786) here because of `===` (3x `=`). But `===` returns `true'/`false`for both`String`AND`Regexp`and thus is more flexible than`==`\n"

    "body": "I see that recently @dg-ratiodata added a helpful method `with_env` to Aruba::API (#188) that allows you to run a block with environment variables set which are then restored back to original values.\n\nHowever, the current implementation seems to run the block once for each env var you pass into the hash. \n\n```\n    def with_env(env = {}, &block)\n      env.each do |k,v|\n        set_env k, v\n        block.call\n        restore_env\n      end\n    end\n```\n\nIs this the intended behaviour? \n\nContext: I want to set a series of env vars before running my process all together,\n\nI can achieve this by calling the underlying methods directly, but I wondered whether you would be happy for me to change this method to set all the vars just once and then call the block. Something like:\n\n```\n    def with_env(env = {}, &block)\n      env.each do |k,v|\n        set_env k, v\n      end\n\n      block.call\n      restore_env\n    end\n```\n\nAppreciate that this breaks existing behaviour and so might be a breaking change for some people - so I would be happy to rename this method or use an alternative approach.\n"

Though it is still possible to use an array of file names, because I \"flatten\" the file names array. The only \"drawback\" is, that it is not possible to set default values anymore if the splat operator is in use.

If you run both tasks or all tasks with `rake spec` within a close enough time window (I think 10 minutes) the results will all be merged so you can get coverage across both the specs and features.  If this PR is accepts, then I'll add another to use coveralls.io to publish the coverage reports to coveralls.io, but someone with admin access will have to setup the hooks on coveralls.io for that.  Additionally, the reports from simplecov are a confirmation that not all steps are being exercised, include the ones dealing with rvm.  I have a fix for that too that I can post in a later PR.\n\n![screen shot 2014-09-25 at 2 04 16 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2230482/4410585/09ea8eb6-44e7-11e4-9572-f7f83ba28451.png)\n# Verifications Steps\n## specs\n- [ ] `rake spec`\n- [ ] VERIFY no failures\n- [ ] `open coverage/index.html`\n- [ ] VERIFY coverage report includes specs\n- [ ] `rm -rf coverage`\n## cucumber\n- [ ] `rake cucumber`\n- [ ] VERIFY no failures\n- [ ] `open coverage/index.html`\n- [ ] VIERFY coverage report includes features and steps\n- [ ] `rm -rf coverage`\n## all\n- [ ] `rake`\n- [ ] VERIFY no failures\n- [ ] `open coverage/index.html`\n- [ ] VERIFY coverage includes specs, features, and steps\n"

I solved the problem by defining a step which modifies the `ENV['HOME']`-variable before each test and using the `~` to reference the home-directory. The only thing missing is the support in `aruba`. The `File.expand_path`-method is able to expand the `~` to the home-directory by using the `ENV['HOME']`-variable. \n\nI added the `File.expand_path`-method to all `aruba`-method to add support for `~`-expanding in all `aruba`-methods. There's also a step now, which mocks the `ENV['HOME']`-variable. \n\nTo make testing a little bit easier I also added two helper `with_env` and `random_string`. The `with_env`-helper uses existing `aruba`-methods to change the process environment during testing for a block of code. The latter is used to generate a random string I used in some tests. I wanted to make sure to not delete files accidently outside `tmp/aruba` while using `~/file_name`.\n\nCheers,\ndg\n"

This is intended behavior in Aruba, of course, since it's supposed to wait for an interactive process to finish in order to prevent race conditions, but it wasn't clear to me that the \"the stdout should contain\" step would by default be affected by this feature.\n\nAn \"I close the stdin stream\" step has been added to Aruba that addresses this problem, but it's undocumented. I've added some brief documentation to the readme that describes how to use it to keep Aruba from timing out in a situation like this.\n"

    "body": "This is a plea for help.\n\nI am trying to come up with tests that use aruba. But I can't find any really useful documentation about it. I get that it's a DSL of some kind, but I'm still new to DSLs and trying to figure out what is actually implemented where and how.\n\nFor example, just my first feature, I have this:\n\nFeature: bare command gives help\n  In order to see what the command does\n  As a user\n  I want to see the help text\n\n  Scenario: App gives help\n    When I run `obfuscate_database`\n    Then the exit status should be 0\n    And the banner should be present\n    And the banner should document that this app takes options\n    And the following options should be documented:\n      |--version|\n    And the banner should document that this app takes 1 arguments\n\nAnd it fails, as I haven't coded that yet, but the last line is not implemented. The example shows that there is a step that matches\n\n```\nAnd the banner should document that this app takes no arguments\n```\n\nAm I expecting too much that this should be something already implemented in aruba, checking that a command line takes a certain number of arguments? I can't figure out where or how such a thing is implemented.\n\nIn just hacking at it, I tried the following things:\n\n```\nAnd the banner should document that this app takes 1 argument\nAnd the banner should document that this app takes one arguments\nAnd the banner should document that this app takes one argument\nAnd the banner should document that this app takes arguments\n```\n\nAll of these result in a pending test.\n\nI know I'm going to want to try other things to make sure the command works as I want, but it's frustrating to supposedly have something that will test a CLI program, but not know anything about how to do so!\n\nThe web sites I've looked at are very short examples. I've not found anything that actually goes into any sort of detail. The aruba gem itself seems to have no rdocs, and the README is pretty useless in describing the actual DSL.\n\nWhat am I not getting here?\n\nThere is an open issue at aruba's github about having rdocs, but I think I'm at a more naive level than even that would help. :(\n"

Here is some investigation:\n   Travis is using RVM as version manager.\n   If I use RVM I get the same result as Travis (failures)\n   If I use rbenv I don't get any errors in ruby runs of specs and\n   cucumber, and jruby runs of specs also passes, only 11 cucumber tests\n   fails with jruby.\n\nI will try to investigate the difference between RVM and rbenv first\nand letting (1) be second priority.\n\nApparently issue 1 does not occur when using childprocess 0.2.3 and using git bisect shows that https://github.com/jarib/childprocess/commit/5488ed454a727d6daf204259e4e80383e9c55065 is the offending commit.\n"

No dice.\n\nThe step that I'm calling the program from is this:\n\nWhen /^I create a world$/ do\n  run_interactive \"world --db #{ db_name }\"\nend\n\nThe world executable exists in the bin/ directory, and runs if called outside of aruba. It also provides lots of diagnostic information to stdout and stderr, that it isn't showing when run with aruba.\n\nIt seems that maybe (like someone else reported, but apparently changed their minds?) @announce isn't working, here. Or maybe there's something I'm getting wrong?\nCheers,\n   Doug.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI have googled enough, but I can't seem to find an answer to this!!\n\nI have this scenario wherein I am testing a command, which would actually go to soem remote server and do a bunch of different things, like starting launching VM's, and then running some process there and then shutting the VM down etc. The command itself, while performing these bunch of tasks spits some information out on the stdout.\n\nI, instead of waiting for the whole time, would like to assert on certain few lines of output and move on. This is because, the command may take anywhere between 5 to 10 min depending on various different factors. Since this is an integration test that I am writing, I am suppose to be connecting to remote machines etc.\n\nThe problem that I am facing is that, although I get the output thrown away form the command in first few seconds,  I can't assert on them and move on declaring the tests as passing, as the test itself fails every time saying that its alive for more than 3 seconds. It does not makes sense for me to increase the timeout of a test to 10 minutes anyways. \n\nCan you please suggets, what should I do to resolve the issue?? \n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI just stumbled upon the following problem in my [poet gem](https://github.com/awendt/poet): I get a `NameError` on the constant `FileUtils` that I didn't require. No problem, add the missing require, problem solved.\n\nBut why does [the test](https://github.com/awendt/poet/blob/master/features/bootstrapping.feature) pass when the gem is broken? I suspect this is because Aruba and Cucumber themselves require \"fileutils\".\n\nCan that really be the problem here? And if so, is it possible to  change that behavior so that programs are run as if I would run them myself?\n\nThanks,\nAndré\n"

However, the output (stderr) of this invocation is a backtrace that is internal to Cucumber creating a possibility for false positives.\n\nMy suggestion is to check if executing the child process command results in an exception and to raise that exception on the \"When\" step instead of silently continuing.\n"

    "body": "As most people know, JRuby suffers from slow startup times even though it performs very well over the lifetime of a long-lived process.  Unfortunately, when you use aruba to test a command line tool on multiple ruby interpreters, including JRuby, you wind up with really, really slow performance on JRuby since the startup times are so bad and aruba is constantly shelling out to create new jruby processes.\n\nThere are a few ENV vars that most people aren't aware of that make a big difference:\n- `JRUBY_OPTS=-X-C` disables the JIT, which is good for short lived scripts\n- `JAVA_OPTS=-d32` forces it to use the client JVM which has better startup times than the server JVM\n\nI got both of these settings from [this blog post](http://blog.headius.com/2010/03/jruby-startup-time-tips.html) for those who are interested.\n\nI just [set these variables for rspec-core](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/commit/1592c942e0d0bd30127e3b8cf89194fe6fd118d6) and it cut **10 minutes** off of the build time.  It allows us to build rspec-core on travis using JRuby.\n\nWe can change this for all the other rspec repos as well...but it got me thinking: why not put these settings directly into aruba itself?  Not many people know about them, and given the short-lived nature of the processes aruba starts, I can't imagine a time when you wouldn't want them.\n\nThoughts?\n"

However, I cannot install it under JRuby, as you are using rdiscount, which is a gem with quite some c code. \n\nMy suggestion is to provide an additional aruba gem which only provides the CLI testing functionality and another gem called aruba-reporting which includes the reporting. \n\nNew suggested structure:\naruba-core\naruba-reporting\naruba\n\nThus, when on windows, you would only need to require aruba-core. All posix people can require aruba which requires aruba-core and aruba-reporting. This should be somewhat backward compatible. \n\nCheers,\nSimon\n"

Moreover my gem uses devise, I tried to debug what's happening, with @announce tag and by putting a `When I run \"rails g --help\"` step in my feature and I saw that devise generators are there, but mine is not.\n\nI'm using aruba 0.4.3, cucumber 0.10.7 and rails 3.0.9\n\nI will release the gem on github in a couple of days, so you can see the complete code.\n\nP.S. I have another question, I put it here, and if it's the case I can open another ticket. When I run features they are ran on a dirty working directory (I added a rm -rf my-used-dir before my steps to avoid it), imho your gem should cleanup everything inside the tmp/aruba directory before running features. Don't you think? Am I missing something?\n"

    "body": "Hi. My question does not relate to the aruba dev, but I cannot think of another place to write it down. I discovered this great lib while browsing the rspec-core doc at relishapp, and started to use it in a gem. So good so far!\n\nHowever, I must explicitely require my lib files within each \"Given a file name … with\" steps (`require File.expand_path(…)`). I saw the rspec features do not do this, but did not found the way autoloading was achieved (nothing under features/support).\n\nThank you.\n"

My interpretation of strings in a feature is that they show what is expected, verbatim. Having to escape quotes in a string that uses another kind of quoting (the triple quotes in this case), doesn't make sense.\n\nIt's also bad that this API breaking change was introduced in a patch-level version, but I've ranted about that in another issue.\n"

    "body": "Yo. \n\nWhile working on interactive support in Aruba, I was surprised a few times by the different ways different verification steps handle quoting and matching of input strings. So I think we should make them consistent. \n\nI've worked on this some in my interactive branch so that all steps with the word \"contain\" in them do this exactly:\n\n1) Unescape\n2) Compare using the include matcher (or just == in the case of the contain exactly steps)\n\nWhile steps with \"match\" do this:\n\n1) Convert to a regex with /#{match_string}/\n2) Compare using the =~ matcher\n\nThis has problems. The check file content helper doesn't follow the rules (yet), but the biggest problem is that \"include\" doesn't provide a diff, which is really super helpful, but I was so frustrated at the time that I gladly took consistent quoting over that. Now that I've cooled off though I'm not so sure.\n\nWhatever is decided, I'll make the changes gladly; I just want to make sure everything is consistent.\n"

    "body": "I was trying to do a case insensitive match using a regex matcher, eg \"/my text/i\", and realized I couldn't so I added it just for regex's. I then realized if I was going to do it for one kind of matcher I should do it for all of them.\n\nI'm a complete Ruby newbie so hopefully I haven't made too many silly mistakes and this is actually useful. I tried to make the additions as easy to use and understandable as possible. Where a regex is given I added a simple matcher for the trailing \"i\" like so \"/blah/i\". In the other matchers I added a regex for \", regardless of case,\" after the \"should\" or \"should not.\" I then modified the api.rb to allow for case insensitive searches but made sure all the added parameters were optional with the default as case sensitive.\n\nIt's a bit verbose but it seems to be fairly clear when reading the Cucumber specs. Though I'm not sure if I should have made separate step definitions for the \", regardless of case,\" matchers. I may have been too clever by half in jamming that all into the same step.\n\nI, of course, followed the behaviour-driven development protocol so there are tests for all added features.\n\nThank you for your time (and all the work you've put into this and the cucumber projects).\n"

Initially I thought that this was strictly a Ruby-1.9.2 problem as all tests passed when run under 1.8.7. However, by slightly increasing the amount of data sent to $stdout the problem also arises in Ruby-1.8.7.\n\nWhile this is, strictly speaking, a problem with the background_process gem itself, its presence makes the use of it in aruba somewhat problematic.\n"
