After the upgrade from cucumber 2.3.3 to 2.4.0 I ran into the error/stacktrace below. The culprit scenario file had not be changed and started failing only after the upgrade to 2.4.0, and was found during a `--dry-run`.\n\n``` code:ruby```\n  Scenario Outline: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\n    Given consectetur adipiscing elit\n    When proin non varius est <page_size> maecenas eu magna tempus <page>\n    Then consectetur nibh eu, cursus diam <count> maecenas\n\n    Examples:\n    Examples:\n      |page_size |page   |count |\n      | 5        |  1    | 5    |\n      | 10       |  2    | 10   |\n      | 25       |  1    | 25   |\n```\n\nThe error happens due to `Examples:` being listed twice for the `Scenario Outline`.

    "body": "Hello, I observe the following behavior.\n= regular cucumber vs SIGINT\n- test is running\n- hit ctrl+c\n- test continue to be running and program exits only after it completes fully\n- hit ctrl+c again\n- cucumber exits without any clean-up taking place\n\n= cucumber with `Signal.trap('SIGINT') { exit(false) }`\n- test running\n- hit ctrl+c\n- test terminates and cucumber switches to After hook\n\nI think that the latter behavior makes much more sense. If user wants to interrupt, then ideally that will happen as soon as possible while After hook is executed to clean-up any underlying test environment. This is current behavior for SIGTERM.\n\nSo I was wondering what was the idea behind default SIGINT trap behavior. Why not keep same as SIGTERM? Not a big issue for me as I have a workaround. But would be nice to make behavior more convenient OOB for other users.\n\nbtw very nice cucumber takes care to run `After` hook on SIGTERM. I made some effort to put clean-up in `at_exit` when `After` is skipped but it seems `After` is never skipped. Or was the idea to have single Ctrl+C terminate after scenario finish, second Ctrl+C to drop into `After` hook? In such case it is not working like that.\n\nHope this is the right repo to file the issue against.\n",

As a bonus, we remove the conceptual overhead of a \"report\".\n# TODO:\n- [x] Add complete tests for the report API in spec/core_spec.rb\n- [x] Port over the tests for the event bus from cucumber/cucumber-ruby\n- [x] Get @tooky and @brasmusson's feedback on the new API - WDYT?\n- [x] Update cucumber to use the new API (see cucumber/cucumber-ruby#973)\n- [x] improve the YARD docs for events\n- [x] fix the readme prose to talk about events not report\n- [x] Ship it!\n",

With the above changes it takes around 1minute and 40 seconds to process all files on the command line. FYI cucumber 1.3.19 takes around 10-15 seconds.\n\nAs far as my testing goes, it is 1:1 compatible with old implementation. You can see f45d34e470c1 though, where duplicates are avoided and processing is faster. Also another two variants in https://github.com/akostadinov/cucumber-ruby-core/tree/all (total 4 variants) but I think this is best.\n\nWould appreciate if somebody can double check compatibility is retained.\n",

    "body": "This PR make Cucumber-Ruby-Core use (the parser of) Gherkin3 instead of Gherkin2. Some notes:\n- The one file apart from the parser that was used from Gherkin2 (tag_expression.rb), is copied into [Cucumber::Core:Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby-core/blob/d2dc089668c1ce9848791c8bc72807f9b77e8d4c/lib/cucumber/core/gherkin/tag_expression.rb) to remove all dependencies to Gherkin2.\n- To be able to use the Gherkin3 parser, a hook method is needed in the parser to be able to subclass the Gherkin3::AstBuilder ([the integrate-ruby-core branch](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin3/commit/bbb09f0c55067ae372f41a8e3aa6ad5bce86f95d))\n- The Cucumber-Ruby-Core AST classes are not created directly from the parser, instead builder are still created by Cucumber::Core::Gherkin:AstBuilder which delays the creation of the AST classes until the whole feature file has been parsed. The main reason to do this is to be able to set the language for the Step and ExamplesTableRow AST classes on creation (so that the AST classes can be immutable). The Step AST class needs the language to be able to calculate the actual keyword for the snippets (\"And\", \"But\" and \"*\" are converted to the appropriate of \"Given\", \"When\" or \"Then\"). The ExamplesTableRow AST class needs the language to be able to supply the \"Scenario\" keyword in the --expand mode.\n- The Gherkin3 parser associates all comments (wherever they occur in the file) with the Feature AST node. To lessen the impact in Cucumber (particular the Pretty and HTML formatter), the comments are distributed down the AST tree at creation, so that the comment appear in the same Cucumber-Ruby-Core AST class as when using Gherkin2 (to be able to do this is another reason to use builders to delay the creation of the AST classes). \n",

It doesn't work in Cucumber 2.0 so I'm trying to learn how to do it in the Cuke 2.0 world and can't find enough documentation to get started.\n\nI've read through the example of using a reporting class and getting it to work but I'm mystified by two things;-\n\n1) How do I plug in a reporting class into real world Cucumber? I can't believe I'd have to write my own runner and plug the reporting class into that. How do I register my reporting class with real world Cucumber in the features/support/env.rb file ?\n2) Having an api to send messages to a report class that responds to certain methods is cool, but Cucumber::Formatter::Html does loads more. Does Cucumber::Formatter::Html behave as a report class, or is it a special case that has a different api?\n\nIs there any documentation or online email conversation I can be pointed to so I can learn how to catch the messages that happen as Cucumber runs and then send information to an external reporting tool?\n\nThanks\n\nJohn Small\n",

We're now modelling the source more precisely, by capturing this\ninformation during the compile.\n\nThe downsides are that the source objects feel quite like they're just \nboilerplate - there's no logic in them yet. The tests have also got a bit more\nawkward - having to create Source objects instead of just arrays.\n\nI think the tests could now leverage this source API in some places, but I\nhaven't tried that out yet.\n\n@tooky @brasmusson I'm interested in your thoughts.\n",

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a general summary description of your changes -->\r\n\r\nIn order to allow embeddings to be transferred from a wire response to a step `Result`, the invocation of a step needs to be capable of returning a data structure. This patch use that data structure (if any, previous design is still allowed) to build the `Result` object.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\n\r\nI'm looking into cucumber-cpp for my company.\r\nWe need to be able to embed text or images into the reports, but that feature is not available when using the wire protocol.\r\n\r\nThis patch is the 2nd of a series of 4, respectively impacting _cucumber-ruby_, _cucumber-ruby-core_, _cucumber-ruby-wire_ and _cucumber-cpp_.\r\n\r\nBasically, the idea is to allow embeddings to be specified in the success or fail responses sent through the wire protocol. E.g.:\r\n```\r\n[\"success\",{\"embeddings\":[{\"label\":\"Embedded text\",\"mime_type\":\"text/plain\",\"src\":\"Some text\"}]}]\r\n[\"fail\",{\"embeddings\":[{\"label\":\"Embedded image\",\"mime_type\":\"image/png;base64\",\"src\":\"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mP8z8BQDwAEhQGAhKmMIQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"}],\"message\":\"There was no  banana\"}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe embeddings will then be stored in the step Result in order to be accessible by the formatter.\r\n\r\nThe patch on _cucumber-ruby_ (cucumber/cucumber-ruby#1354) will let formatters access embeddings stored in a step result.\r\nThe patch on _cucumber-ruby-core_ (cucumber/cucumber-ruby-core#170) will store in the step result the embeddings returned by the step invocation.\r\nThe patch on _cucumber-ruby-wire_ (cucumber/cucumber-ruby-wire#20) will allow the embeddings stored in the wire response to be returned by the wire-based step invocation process.\r\nThe patch on _cucumber-cpp_ (cucumber/cucumber-cpp#223) will allow C++ steps to send embeddings through wire responses.\r\n\r\nNote: embeddings were not considered to be useful for pending steps, but support should be possible if required.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, it's not possible to access data from the wire response as nothing is returned from the wire invocation when a step succeed (a step is considered successful by default, an exception needs to be raised in case of failing or pending step).\r\n\r\n**Successful step**\r\n```\r\nCucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase::Status::Base.execute\r\n  Cucumber::Core::Test::Step.execute\r\n    Cucumber::Core::Test::Action.execute\r\n      block -> Cucumber::StepMatch.invoke\r\n        Cucumber::Wire::StepDefinition.invoke\r\n          Cucumber::Wire::Protocol.invoke\r\n

Cucumber::Wire::DataPacket reponse = // parsed packet\r\n                  Cucumber::Wire::DataPacket.handle_with\r\n                    Cucumber::Wire::DataPacket.handle_success // noop\r\n                  // response discarded\r\n      Cucumber::Core::Test::Action.passed -> return Cucumber::Core::Test::Result::Passed\r\n

Cucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase@status = Cucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase::Status::Passing\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Failing step**\r\n```\r\nCucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase::Status::Base.execute\r\n  Cucumber::Core::Test::Step.execute\r\n    Cucumber::Core::Test::Action.execute\r\n      block -> Cucumber::StepMatch.invoke\r\n        Cucumber::Wire::StepDefinition.invoke\r\n          Cucumber::Wire::Protocol.invoke\r\n            Cucumber::Wire::Protocol::Requests::Invoke.execute\r\n              Cucumber::Wire::RequestHandler.execute\r\n                Cucumber::Wire::Connection.call_remote\r\n                  Cucumber::Wire::DataPacket reponse = // parsed packet\r\n                  Cucumber::Wire::DataPacket.handle_with\r\n                    Cucumber::Wire::RequestHandler.handle_fail -> throw Cucumber::Wire::Exception // error message (from response) embedded in exception\r\n                  // response discarded\r\n      Rescue in Cucumber::Core::Test::Action.execute\r\n        Cucumber::Core::Test::Action.failed -> return Cucumber::Core::Test::Result::Failed\r\n  Cucumber::Core::Test::Result::Failed.describe_to(Cucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase)\r\n    Cucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase.failed\r\n      Cucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase@status = Cucumber::Core::Test::Runner::RunningTestCase::Status::Failing\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch does three things:\r\n- It adds an `embeddings` field to the `Passed` and `Failed` responses and make their `describe_to` methods notify visitors from the availability of embeddings.\r\n- It creates two new classes, `PassedInvokeResult` and `FailedInvokeResult`, to be returned by what is effectively invoking the step.\r\n- Add code to allow an `Action` to check if the invocation of a step returned one of those objects, and create a `Passed` or `Failed` result accordingly.\r\n\r\nThose changes should be backward compatible: successful step invocations that return nothing, failing step invocations that throw an exception and other behaviors are still supported.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!--- Please add tests for changes to the code, otherwise we probably won't merge it -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\r\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nAdd the embeddings field to the unit tests verifying the visitor mechanism of Result.\r\nAdd unit tests to verify that Action.execute returns a Passed/Failed object when the invocation of a step returns an PassedInvokeResult/FailedInvokeResult object (previous tests already verify that current behaviors still continue to work).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Refactor (code change that does not change external functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! -->\r\n- [x] I've added tests for my code\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n",

This is made explicit by the Gherkin compiler in that a Pickle Step has a locations attribute, that in case of that the Pickle Step was compiled from a Scenario Outline contains both the location of the Outline Step and the Example Table Row. The Cucumber-Ruby compiler does not take this into account, the `Ast::Step`, `Ast::ExpandedOutlineStep` and `Test::Step` all (through include of the `HasLocation` module) all respond to the `#location` method to provide one and only one location. In case of `Ast::ExpandedOutlineStep` and `Test::Step` the location provided is the location of the Example Table Row. \r\n\r\nSince `Ast::ExpandedOutlineStep` and `Test::Step` has two equally important locations (neither cannot be deduced from the other), they should in principle not provide a `#location` method. However since the use of the `HasLocation` module and the `#location` method is ubiquitous and depended on in many placed. This PR instead introduce a `#original_location` on `Ast::Step` and `Ast::ExpandedOutlineStep` so that both the locations of a Test Step from a Scenario Outline can be easily accessible from the source (`#source.last`) of the Test Step, without first having to determine whether the Test Step comes from a Scenario or a Scenario Outline.\r\n\r\nFixes #149.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThe automated test suite has been extended to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] I've added tests for my code\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n",

A Pickle steps created by the Gherkin compiler for steps of scenario outlines contains both the location of the outline step and the location of the example table row instantiating the scenario outline.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCucumber-Ruby-Core should support that both the location of the outline step and the example table row instantiating the scenario outline is easily accessible, by for instance formatters, of test steps from scenario outlines.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nCurrently Cucumber-Ruby-Core defines the single location of a test steps from scenario outlines as the location of the example table row instantiating the scenario outline. This has caused a regression compared to Cucumber-Ruby v1.x.x in both the Pretty Formatter and the Json Formatter (see cucumber/cucumber-ruby#1108).\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nFor instance define a method `#original_location` that for `ExpandedOutlineStep`s return the location of the `OutlineStep` it was expanded from, and that for `Step`s return the same location as the `#location` method.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n\r\nSee cucumber/cucumber-ruby#1108.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nTo be able to fix the regressions from Cucumber-Ruby v1.x.x.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nAlso for test cases from scenario outlines the location abstraction similarly limited, but that is not causing any regressions.",

    "body": "Hi folks! I'm back with another DataTable-related bugfix. When being built, DataTables would build their `Ast::Location` with only the first line. In the following example feature, this led to commands like `cucumber features/test.feature:5` working, but `cucumber features/test.feature:6` not running any tests, because no `Test::Case` reported containing that line.\r\n\r\n```cucumber\r\nScenario: Run scenario with a data table\r\n  Given a file named \"features/test.feature\" with:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Feature: \r\n\r\n      Scenario: DataTable\r\n        Given this step is a table step\r\n          | a | b |\r\n          | c | d |\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n  When I run `cucumber features/test.feature:6 --format pretty --quiet`\r\n  Then it should pass with exactly:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Feature: \r\n\r\n      Scenario: DataTable\r\n        Given this step is a table step\r\n          | a | b |\r\n          | c | d |\r\n\r\n    1 scenario (1 passed)\r\n    1 step (1 passed)\r\n      \r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure how best to test this. My first inclination is to add a unit test, but there appear to be no unit tests in this project for `Cucumber::Core::Gherkin::AstBuilder` or any of its internals. The cucumber acceptance test above could be added to the parent `cucumber/cucumber-ruby` project, but it seems a bit too edge-casey for a full acceptance test, IMO.

Windows 10, however, natively supports it. So I introduce a way for Cucumber to detect more \"modern\" Windows versions\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nAs of Windows 10 Microsoft does support ANSI colors in the Command prompt. Even more colors have been added in the Creators Update (256):\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/04/11/windows-10-creators-update-whats-new-in-bashwsl-windows-console/\r\n\r\nI have introduced Cucumber::WINDOWS_MODERN flag, which checks the output of the 'ver' console command. It RegEx matches if the Windows version is equal or higher than Creators Update (10.0.15063).\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nCucumber is unnecessary requiring ANSICON for Windows 10, where ANSI colored output is supported. Fix that by outputting colors on Windows versions that support them\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI have tested it on Windows 10 Anniversary and Creators Updates\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for my code\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n",

Because of this, it's not possible to distinguish the steps from each other, as the line number is their unique value.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Cucumber 1.3.20 the correct JSON output is given, I've cut out the important pieces:\r\n```gherkin\r\nFeature: This is line 1\r\n\r\n  Scenario Outline: This is line 3\r\n    Given this step is line 4\r\n    When when this step uses \"<outline-item>\" this should be line 5\r\n    Then this is line 6\r\n    Examples:\r\n      | outline-item   |\r\n      | example-line-9 |\r\n```\r\n```terminal\r\ncucumber --f json >> output.json\r\n```\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"keyword\": \"Feature\",\r\n    \"name\": \"This is line 1\",\r\n    \"line\": 1,\r\n    \"elements\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"keyword\": \"Scenario Outline\",\r\n        \"name\": \"This is line 3\",\r\n        \"line\": 9,\r\n        \"steps\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"keyword\": \"Given \",\r\n            \"name\": \"this step is line 4\",\r\n            \"line\": 4 # <---\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"keyword\": \"When \",\r\n            \"name\": \"when this step uses \\\"example-line-9\\\" this should be line 5\",\r\n            \"line\": 5 # <---\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"keyword\": \"Then \",\r\n            \"name\": \"this is line 6\",\r\n            \"line\": 6 # <---\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nNote how the step line numbers are the same as the actual line number of the step.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIn cucumber 2.4.0 the following JSON output is given:\r\n```JSON\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"uri\": \"features/outline_test.feature\",\r\n    \"id\": \"this-is-line-1\",\r\n    \"keyword\": \"Feature\",\r\n    \"name\": \"This is line 1\",\r\n    \"description\": \"\",\r\n    \"line\": 1,\r\n    \"elements\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"this-is-line-1;this-is-line-3;;2\",\r\n        \"keyword\": \"Scenario Outline\",\r\n        \"name\": \"This is line 3\",\r\n        \"description\": \"\",\r\n        \"line\": 9, # <--- This is correct, it refers to the line number of the example\r\n        \"type\": \"scenario\",\r\n        \"steps\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"keyword\": \"Given \",\r\n            \"name\": \"this step is line 4\",\r\n            \"line\": 9 # <--- Should be line 4\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"keyword\": \"When \",\r\n            \"name\": \"when this step uses \\\"example-line-9\\\" this should be line 5\",\r\n            \"line\": 9 # <--- Should be line 5\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"keyword\": \"Then \",\r\n            \"name\": \"this is line 6\",\r\n            \"line\": 9 # <--- Should be line 6\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nThis issue has affected us at spriteCloud in the following way:\r\n- We run Cucumber and screenshots are saved on the server it ran on.\r\n- Then the screenshots are exported to the results database\r\n- Before exporting, the file is linked to the step where the screenshot was taken\r\nThis is going fine with regular Scenario's, but when it is an Outline we're not able to link the screenshot to the step and thus we can't visualize the given error.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n<!--- If you're reporting a bug, include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n* Version used: Cucumber 2.4.0\r\n* Operating System and version: Windows 10, Ubuntu 16 and other linux systems.\r\n* Link to your project: http://calliope.pro\r\n",
