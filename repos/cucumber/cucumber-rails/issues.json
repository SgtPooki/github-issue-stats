Here's the excerpt from my `ApplicationController`:\n\n```\ndef default_locale\n  current_user ? current_user.locale : I18n.default_locale\nend\n\ndef default_url_options options={}\n  (I18n.locale.to_s.eql?(default_locale) ? { locale: nil } : { locale: I18n.locale }).merge options\nend\n```\n\nI alredy figured out, that I can use the following setup for my unit tests:\n\n```\nclass ActionView::TestCase::TestController\n  def default_url_options options={}\n    subject.default_url_options options\n  end\nend\n```\n\nSo is it possible to do anything similar to specify, that the `_path` helpers in my features use the `default_url_options` method from the `ApplicationController`?\n"

Around March 3rd we started noticing that our Gemfile.lock file was being recreated when we started the rails server or ran our automated tests.  We have the following in our Gemfile\n\n```\ngroup :test do\n  gem \"cucumber-rails\", \"1.4.3\", require: false\nend\n```\n\nThe Gemfile.lock is modified to remove the following gems\n\n```\n-    cucumber-core (1.3.1)\n-      gherkin3 (~> 3.1.0)\n-    cucumber-wire (0.0.1)\n-    event-bus (0.1.0)\n-    gherkin3 (3.1.2)\n```\n\nIf I change the gem version to 1.4.2 the problem goes away.  If I leave 1.4.3 in place, delete Gemfile.lock and try to a do a full bundle, bundler generates a Gemfile.lock with the above gems in place.  As soon as I start the rails server, the Gemfile.lock is modified again.  I'm not sure why the version of cucumber-raiils would matter when starting the rails server (since it's not in the :development group and require is false).\n\nWe're using Puma as the primary development server and Rails is 4.2.5.2.  I've verified this problem exists with Webrick and Unicorn as well.\n"

    "body": "Hello everyone, \n\nRecently I got this issue. I move my model layer and db/migration to rails engine, and setup my test database with seed data. When I start to run cucumber, it start to drop the table and re-do migration. If I did the same this but removing the append_migrations block in engine.rb. When I start to run cucumber, it work properly.  Should I make more setting for engine, like add path or something like that? \n\nHere is my setting: https://gist.github.com/wellsonjain/790f40a6b299f09776ce\n"

Now it appears from \n...\\lib\\ruby\\gems\\2.0.0\\gems\\activerecord-4.0.3\\lib\\active_record\\railties\\databases.rake\n\nthat prepare is now only the task to 'Check for pending migrations and load the test schema'\n\nI had to update all occurrences of test:prepare in cucumber.rake, such as in:\n\n```\nCucumber::Rake::Task.new({:wip => 'test:prepare'}, 'Run features that are being worked on') do |t|\n  t.binary = vendored_cucumber_bin\n  t.fork = true # You may get faster startup if you set this to false\n  t.profile = 'wip'\nend\n```\n\nwith db:test:clone to get rake cucumber to rebuild my test database prior to running mu cucumber features.\n\nSo shouldn't the cucumber.rake task generated now be using db:test:clone?\n\nI should note that I am using\n\n```\nconfig.active_record.schema_format = :sql\n```\n\nin application.rb\n\nand also had to add the line to application.rb:\n\nActiveRecord::Base.schema_format = config.active_record.schema_format\n\nas a workaround as ActiveRecord::Base.schema_format was still being evaluated as :ruby in the clone task of databases.rake and is supposed to evaluate as :sql as a result of my config setting\n\nruby 2.0.0p353\nrails 4.0.3\ncucumber 1.3.10\ncucumber-rails 1.4.0\nOS Win64\n"

    "body": "RubyGems.org doesn't report a license for your gem.  This is because it is not specified in the [gemspec](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/20#license) of your last release.\n\nvia e.g.\n\n```\nspec.license = 'MIT'\n# or\nspec.licenses = ['MIT', 'GPL-2']\n```\n\nIncluding a license in your gemspec is an easy way for rubygems.org and other tools to check how your gem is licensed.  As you can imagine, scanning your repository for a LICENSE file or parsing the README, and then attempting to identify the license or licenses is much more difficult and more error prone. So, even for projects that already specify a license, including a license in your gemspec is a good practice. See, for example, how [rubygems.org uses the gemspec to  display the rails gem license](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails).\n\nThere is even a [License Finder gem](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) to help companies/individuals ensure all gems they use meet their licensing needs. This tool depends on license information being available in the gemspec.  This is an important enough issue that _even Bundler now generates gems with a default 'MIT' license_.\n\nI hope you'll consider specifying a license in your gemspec. If not, please just close the issue with a nice message. In either case, I'll follow up. Thanks for your time!\n\nAppendix:\n\nIf you need help choosing a [license](http://opensource.org/licenses) (sorry, I haven't checked your readme or looked for a license file), GitHub has created a [license picker tool](http://choosealicense.com/).  Code without a license specified defaults to 'All rights reserved'-- denying others all rights to use of the code.\nHere's a [list of the license names I've found and their frequencies](https://github.com/bf4/gemproject/blob/master/license_usage.csv)\n\np.s. In case you're wondering how I found you and why I made this issue, it's because I'm collecting stats on gems (I was originally looking for download data) and decided to collect license metadata,too, and [make issues for gemspecs not specifying a license as a public service :)](https://github.com/bf4/gemproject/issues/1). See the previous link or my [blog post about this project for more information](http://www.benjaminfleischer.com/2013/07/12/make-the-world-a-better-place-put-a-license-in-your-gemspec/).\n"

This means that you cannot use it with cucumber versions > 1.1.9. Is this intentional? \n\nFrom what I can see, cucumber did not use semantic versioning at that point - 1.2.0 doesn't seem to be API breaking, at least according to the [history](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/History.md).\n\nI guess the fix is to change the dependency declaration to >=1.1.0 (similar to all the other declarations surrounding it).\n"

I see that you added rails as a runtime dependency to the gemspec (which makes sense), but it is defined as\n\n```\ns.add_runtime_dependency('rails', '~> 3.0')\n```\n\nCould you relax it to\n\n```\ns.add_runtime_dependency('rails', '>= 3.0')\n```\n\nor \n\n```\ns.add_runtime_dependency('rails', '>= 3.0', '< 4.1')\n```\n\nor something similar? That would make it possible to use that version with rails 4.\n\nBest regards,\nFabian\n"

The test suite now runs against the latest versions of:\n- Rails 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2\n- Capybara 1.1 and 2.0\n\nI haven't been able to get the tests running against Rails 4.0 yet because mongoid doesn't support it (and its gemspec blocks installation). The Ruby 2.0 tests only run against Rails 3.2, to save on travis cycles.\n\nI've removed from the gemspec anything that was there solely to provide dependencies for auto-generated apps. This is so Appraisal can omit anything that other rails versions don't need (or clash with, e.g. coffee-rails and rails 3.0). These dependencies now live in the main Gemfile above the gemspec declaration.\n\nApart from adding a Rails ~> 3.0 specification in the gemspec, I haven't touched any gem versions; the main Gemfile.lock is excluded from the repo anyway, so contributors will automatically get the most recent matching gems at the time of install. The lock files for the appraisal gemfiles are committed, however, so we know the build is being run against a consistent set of gems.\n\nThe default test task still runs against Rails 3.2 only. For contributors, the default workflow is unchanged:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails.git\n$ bundle install\n$ rake\n```\n\nI've added rake tasks for running the different gemfile tests:\n\n```\n$ rake gemfiles:install        # roughly \"bundle install\" for gemfiles/*.gemfile\n$ rake test:all                # run test suite against gemfiles/*.gemfile\n$ rake test:gemfile[rails_3_0] # run test suite against named gemfile\n```\n\nI think that about covers it - now to see what travis makes of it all.\n"

At minimum, someone that also sees the deprecation of ActionController::Integration in Rails 4 can use this fork temporarily until Rails 4 is released and it is worth creating a Rails4 branch with all the necessary modifications.\n\nIt is worth noting this does work in Rails 3 as ActionController::Integration is also available within ActionDispatch::Integration already as well.\n"

    "body": "While running rspec, I am getting strange warning messages from cucumber:\n\n```\n$ bundle exec rspec\nWARNING: Cucumber-rails required outside of env.rb.  The rest of loading is being defered until env.rb is called.\n  To avoid this warning, move 'gem cucumber-rails' under only group :test in your Gemfile\n```\n\nThe warning message suggests that I move 'gem cucumber-rails' so that it is only under the group :test in my Gemfile. That is already the case for me, but I still get the warning. I can make the warning go away by putting `gem 'cucumber-rails', require: false` in my gem file instead of just `gem 'cucumber-rails'`, but something tells me that isn't the best solution.\n\n_Note: This is related to the (closed) pull request https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/pull/171._\n"

To be clear: The inheritance of `edit`, `update`, `delete`, etc. all work fine. There is just something special about `create` that causes problems, but I am not sure what it is.\n- cucumber 1.2.1\n- cucumber-rails 1.3.0\n- rails 3.2.7\n"

    "body": "I've been trying to fix this issue for two days straight now and I can't for the life of me find the solution to this problem:\n\nThe day before yesterday I added my first `@javascript` scenario. I tried the scenario first without the @javascript tag, which worked, except of course the part where I needed JavaScript working to continue. Next thing I did was add `@javascript` to the scenario. This time, the scenario failed at an earlier step, namely a step where the browser visits a subdomain, bass on an account.\n\nThe account exists in the database (verified through test.log and actual tests) so the browser opens in `myaccount.website.dev`, but then when the page opens, the page shows the error that there is no account by that name. To verify this I printed `Account.all.inspect` on the error page, and it showed the seeded data (got there unintentionally through db:reset), but not the data created earlier in the scenario.\n\nHere's my current `env.rb`, but I tried a lot of different settings (as you can see by the commented out lines) like transactions without database cleaner, using José Valim's hack (which I did get working in RSpec), transactions without the hack, truncation, but nothing seems to work.\n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'spork'\n\nSpork.prefork do\n  unless ENV['DRB']\n    require 'simplecov'\n    SimpleCov.start 'rails'\n  end\n\n  require 'cucumber/rails'\n  Capybara.default_selector = :css\n  Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit\n\n  #Rails.logger.level = 4\nend\n\nSpork.each_run do\n  if ENV['DRB']\n    require 'simplecov'\n    SimpleCov.start 'rails'\n  end\n\n  require 'factory_girl_rails'\n\n  # Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = true\n  ActionController::Base.allow_rescue = false\n\n  ActiveRecord::Base.instantiate_observers if Spork.using_spork?\n\n  # class ActiveRecord::Base\n  #   mattr_accessor :shared_connection\n  #   @@shared_connection = nil\n\n  #   def self.connection\n  #     @@shared_connection || retrieve_connection\n  #   end\n  # end\n\n  # ActiveRecord::Base.shared_connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection\n\n  # Remove/comment out the lines below if your app doesn't have a database.\n  # For some databases (like MongoDB and CouchDB) you may need to use :truncation instead.\n  begin\n   DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation\n  rescue NameError\n   raise \"You need to add database_cleaner to your Gemfile (in the :test group) if you wish to use it.\"\n  end\n\n  # Before '@javascript' do\n  #   ActiveRecord::Base.shared_connection = nil\n  #   Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = false\n  #   DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation\n  #   DatabaseCleaner.start\n  # end\n\n  # After '@javascript' do\n  #   DatabaseCleaner.clean\n  #   DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction\n  # end\n\n  # You may also want to configure DatabaseCleaner to use different strategies for certain features and scenarios.\n  # See the DatabaseCleaner documentation for details. Example:\n  #\n  #   Before('@no-txn,@selenium,@culerity,@celerity,@javascript') do\n  #     # { :except => [:widgets] } may not do what you expect here\n  #     # as tCucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy overrides\n  #     # this setting.\n  #     DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation\n  #   end\n  #\n  #   Before('~@no-txn', '~@selenium', '~@culerity', '~@celerity', '~@javascript') do\n  #     DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction\n  #   end\n  #\n\n  # Possible values are :truncation and :transaction\n  # The :transaction strategy is faster, but might give you threading problems.\n  # See https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/blob/master/features/choose_javascript_database_strategy.feature\n  Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy = :truncation\n\nend\n\n```\n"

    "body": "cucumber-rails [monkeypatches Active Record](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/blob/v1.2.1/lib/cucumber/rails/hooks/active_record.rb#L2-8) to add a `shared_connection` class attribute:\n\n```\nclass ActiveRecord::Base\n  class_attribute :shared_connection\n\n  def self.connection\n    self.shared_connection || retrieve_connection\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis is [used by the shared connection strategy](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/blob/v1.2.1/lib/cucumber/rails/database.rb#L53-61) to force all threads to share a connection per model:\n\n```\nActiveRecord::Base.shared_connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection\nActiveRecord::Base.descendants.each do |model|\n  model.shared_connection = model.connection\nend\n```\n\nHowever, this latter code is broken in the presence of `ActiveRecord::Base` subclasses which use `establish_connection` to open a different connection (e.g. against a different database) from the one used by `Base`:\n- class attributes are [inherited by subclasses](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.1.3/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/class/attribute.rb#L6-7);\n- as above, cucumber-rails overrides the [original implementation](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.1.3/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_specification.rb#L88-90) of `ActiveRecord::Base.connection` to default it to the `shared_connection` class attribute whenever the latter has been set;\n- as above, the shared connection strategy sets each model class's `shared_connection` to its current `connection`, starting with `ActiveRecord::Base` and then iterating through its [descendants](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.1.3/activesupport/lib/active_support/descendants_tracker.rb#L11-16);\n- but since `ActiveRecord::Base.shared_connection` is set first, every descendant inherits `ActiveRecord::Base`'s `shared_connection` (because `shared_connection` is inherited by subclasses), which then becomes each descendant's `connection` (because the replacement `ActiveRecord::Base.connection` implementation defaults to the value of `shared_connection`), which then gets assigned as each descendant's `shared_connection`;\n- so every descendant's `shared_connection` is set to `ActiveRecord::Base`'s `shared_connection`;\n- so every descendant's `connection` is set to `ActiveRecord::Base`'s `connection`.\n\nThe upshot is that any model class which expects to use a different connection from the one used by `ActiveRecord::Base` will be made to use `ActiveRecord::Base`'s connection during JavaScript scenarios, and will therefore break.\n\nPotential solutions might involve:\n1. figuring out the correct order of descendants on which to set `shared_connection` without clobbering anything;\n2. taking advantage of inheritance by only setting `shared_connection` on the classes which establish their own connection, instead of setting it on all descendants; and/or\n3. avoiding inheritance entirely by using a genuinely per-class attribute instead of the `class_attribute`.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI am stuck with a very weird issue and was wondering whether anybody here could give some help.\nI am using cucumber (1.1.4), cucumber-rails (1.2.1), capybara (1.1.2) with capybara-webkit (0.7.2) for the @javascript enabled scenarios, and the default rack_test driver for all the other scenarios.\n\nThe weird thing is that, give one sample feature with just one normal scenario (rack_test) and another @javascript enabled scenario, the following happens:\n\n1) if I run each scenario individually, both run fine;\n2) if I run the whole feature, and the @javascript scenario is the last one/follows the rack_test one, all is OK.\n3) BUT if I invert the order and have the @javascript scenario first and then the normal one, the JavaScript scenario passes while the second one fails with \"Capybara::InfiniteRedirectError\".\n\nAny idea? I have been looking for wrong redirections etc in my app but I can't find anything that would explain this behaviour and anyway, as said, the problem only happens unless the @javascript scenarios follow the normal ones, in which case all scenarios pass.\n\nWhat could possibly change depending on whether @javascript tagged scenarios come first or after? \nI could post some code snippets if you suggest what you would need to check.\n\nI've also posted the same issue to the Capybara (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/581) and Capybara-Webkit  (https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/issues/232) projects as I am not sure of where this would belong.\n\nThanks in advance!\n"

We really like the more flexible change you did instead, but unfortunately, we discovered while testing it that it doesn't work with our app, because we use a truncation strategy implemented by our own custom module, instead of DatabaseCleaner (which reminds us, you might want to require DBCleaner in the ... gemspec? we're not really sure, since it's a conditional dependency). We were wondering if you'd accept this patch to allow custom DB strategies. Thanks!\n"

    "body": "I did some research into the use of Cucumber by the programmers around me and I looked at six open source Rails projects on github. In nearly everything I saw, programmers wrote 'acceptance tests' almost exclusively with the web_steps or in composite steps built from the web steps. But this defeats the purpose of using Cucumber: such tests are far too low level. In reality they are integration tests. Worse, they are integration tests written in a difficult syntax. Cucumber's advantages vanish in these cases.\n\nAccording to BDD expert Elizabeth Keogh “If your scenario starts with “When the user enters ‘Smurf’ into ‘Search’ text box…” then that’s far too low-level. However, even “When the user adds ‘Smurf’ to his basket, then goes to the checkout, then pays for the goods” is also too low-level. You’re looking for something like, “When the user buys a Smurf.”\n\nWe're all Cuking it wrong, and the problem starts with the bad example set by the web_steps.rb file. I vote to remove it permanently so as to encourage people to write their step definitions in Capybara, saving time and encouraging real acceptance tests over use of Cucumber as an awkward integration test framework.\n\nI've written in depth about it on my blog:[Why Bother With Cucumber](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/09/26/why-bother-with-cucumber-testing.html)\n"

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nAfter upgrade Cucumber to the latest version, I ran `rails g cucumber:install` as usual. I've then add/remove stuff to make it compatible with our project. However, it turned out that the new generator doesn't generate this line anymore:\n\n``` ruby\nENV[\"RAILS_ENV\"] ||= \"test\"\n```\n\nAt first I thought that Cucumber would change my environment automatically, but I realize that I'm wrong because my development database got wiped every time I run Cucumber. I think this should be fixed.\n\nThanks for the great work of Cucumber.\n"

    "body": "I have a feature that uses data from two separate database. This feature does not work when using cucumber-rails 1.0.2. The issue is that the first connection, to the regular Rails database, get stored as @@shared_connection in ActiveRecord::Base by the cucumber-rails active_record hook (lib/cucumber/rails/hooks/active_record.rb). After a connection to the second database is established, ActiveRecord::Base.connection still returns the @@shared_connection which is a connection to the wrong database.\n\nA solution is to keep such a shared_connection per connection specification with which establish_connection has been invoked. \n\nThere are however other problems with this hook. For instance, it prevents you from writing features to test massively concurrent use of an application, by creating a bottleneck where the actual application has none.  \n\nThe code was added in commit https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/commit/cbcfd88dc983340281db20915a80e3831c8f6950, but the commit message does not really explain why it was necessary.\n"

Can anyone help me with this?\n"

    "body": "Hey Aslak,\n\nI've done my best to patch in my changes from my [blog post](http://bjeanes.com/2010/09/19/selector-free-cucumber-scenarios) regarding removing CSS/XPath from scenarios, considering I couldn't get the tests to run at all.\n\nSince my approach is similar in form to that of the `paths.rb` helper, I've tried to copy the limited tests and implementation around that file and apply it to my `selectors.rb` file. Given that I can't run the tests, I've spent a lot of time reviewing the commits to make sure they should work, but if there are any issues please let me know.\n\nAs to the actual changes, I've managed to refactor the capybara steps substantially to take advantage of my wildcard-within approach to handle the scoping. This means that the steps have cleaner regexp and cleaner body. This refactoring includes the Czech, Danish, Spanish, Norwegian, and Portuguese languages (which all actually got a functionality boost by having the wildcard steps work across ALL steps). \n\nThe other languages have syntaxes that won't quite work with my approach, but I've tweaked my `selectors.rb` implementation so that it should be backwards compatible with anyone still using `... within \"#some.css\"` for all languages (including the ones I refactored).\n\nI think my changes are a really nice improvement to how steps should be scoped (both from an implementation and philosophical point of view) with the added bonus of increasing code readability and functionality.\n\nHopefully, I didn't miss anything and they just work. If something doesn't quite work as expected, I'll make myself available to help you get it working, of course.\n\nCheers,\nBo\n"

Now, make the feature fail, by introducing an error in the feature, e.g. edit the line `When I fill in \"Titlexyz\" with \"title 1\"`. Now run `rake cucumber` again. This time it should correctly report `cannot fill in, no text field`. Run `rake cucumber` once again.\n\nCucumber even suggests me implementing steps like\n\n```\nGiven /^I am on the new post page$/ do\n  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had\nend\n```\n\nThis behavior happens until I delete the rerun.txt, which contains the line\n\n```\nfeatures/foo/manage_posts.feature:6\n```\n\nReproduced with the lastest commit 50992e of cucumber-rails.\n"

Some projects are shifting away to other persistence layers, such as document stores like Mongo DB, which has no transactions (to improve performance and scalability!).\nTo simulate transactions, we could take advantage of versioning, currently natively supported by fx Mongoid.\n\nclass Person\n  include Mongoid::Document\n  include Mongoid::Versioning\nend\n\nOn running cucumber, each model class could be expanded to include this Versioning module (meta-programming) and then also add a previous_version method. Then somehow call previous_version on all documents affected after each test. Each test must then somehow ensure that an index is generated listing all documents with a counter for each saying how many times it was mutated. Then call previous_version that number of times for each. In effect this index would act as kind of a diff. Any other viable solutions?  \n\nMongoMapper also supports versioning: fx http://github.com/mrkurt/versioned\n\n```\nclass Doc\n  include MongoMapper::Document\n  include Versioned\n  key :title, String\nend\n```\n"

However, @emulate_rails_javascript properly goes to \"http://localhost:9887/posts\" and the Scenario passes.  If I replace \"visit posts_url\" with \"visit '/posts'\", Culerity goes to the right host, but it still fails the Scenario because it, sadly, cannot follow the new Rails 3 UJS hrefs.\n\nI think posts_url.to_str is throwing me off trying to find out who's fault this is, because whenever I puts/print/p posts_url in my step definition, I always get \"http://www.example.com/posts\".\n\nI have been trying to figure out exactly where this comes from without any luck so I am not sure if this is a cucumber-rails issue or somewhere else in the capybara->culerity->celerity chain.\n"

This results in a segmentation fault in YAML (on my system), which was difficult to track down since I had no indication that the generate script would touch database.yml.  The resulting error was difficult to trace since database.yml is frequently ignored in SCM; you can't rely on git to tell you it has been altered.\n\nFor me this behavior is far too magical and clever.  The generate script should ask before it touches database.yml, or better yet print instruction so I can easily edit it myself.  There are far too many edge cases for this to be done correctly.

The above now performs a logical AND whereas I believe it is meant to represent a logical OR instead. The revised code should be:\n\n```\nBefore('~@no-txn,~@selenium,~@culerity,~@javascript') do\n  Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = $__cucumber_global_use_txn\nend\n\nBefore('@no-txn,@selenium,@culerity,@javascript') do\n  Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = false\nend\n```\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't actually tried making this change yet to verify (took me ages to figure out why my @sphinx scenarios weren't running in a non-transaction). Not sure what affect this would have any the rest of cucumber-rails and I wasn't clear on whether this change needed to have a feature written for it and where that would go (no features inside cucumber-rails). I figured this was a straightforward change that was simply overlooked with the 0.6.0 changes.\n"

    "body": "The current step definition for the \"Then I should be on...\" step uses (for webrat) the URI#path method. Previously this was changed to use #request_uri instead, which resolved the issue with the query string not being used in comparisons.\n\nAt some point this regressed, however even this change is insufficient because after a \"When I follow ...\" step the current_url variable contains a relative URL, causing URI.parse to return a URI::Generic object instead of a URI::HTTP object; the former does not implement the #request_uri method. Below is the clunky code I'm using to work around this:\n\n```\nThen /^(?:|I )should be on (.+)$/ do |page_name|\n  # Locally patched, replacing #path with #request_uri and then custom implementation.\n  current_path = URI.parse(current_url).select(:path, :query).compact.join('?')\n  if defined?(Spec::Rails::Matchers)\n    current_path.should == path_to(page_name)\n  else\n    assert_equal path_to(page_name), current_path\n  end\nend\n```\n"
