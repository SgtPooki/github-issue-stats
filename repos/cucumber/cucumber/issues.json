Added a unit test there. \r\nVerified that my json report processor which works with 1.2.5 picks up the docstrings.\r\n\r\nRan all tests in cucumber-jvm. Examples: Pax-Exam : Calculator Test is broken before and after the change due to a missing deployment I think.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [x ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected).\r\n\r\nAdds a field to PickleString. Not sure if that gets serialised within this project. \r\nMaintains the old constructor signature to avoid compile breaks. Could be deprecated.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! -->\r\n- [x] I've added tests for my code.\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nNot sure which if any docs should be updated - I think 1.2.5 preserved docs will now be correct."

Please follow the guidelines below and if you have any questions, please ask!\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n* Naming: Files must be named `CHANGELOG.md`. If they are anything else, please rename them to fit.\r\n* Line entry format: `[Module] Message ([Issue Link], [Issue Link] Contributor Name One, Contributor Name Two)` (Link to user's github if available) See the [Gherkin CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/gherkin/CHANGELOG.md) for an example.\r\n* Entries should be grouped into one of the following: `Removed`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`. Please prefix with an H3 tag. Aka `###`\r\n* Existing entries in files do not need to be completely updated, but please make sure that mentions to issues/pull requests such as `(PR #123)` are updated to be point to an appropriate Github URL.\r\n  * Example: `(#123)` would turn into `[#123](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/123]` or [#123](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/pull/123)\r\n  * Don't worry about being correct with pull/issue as they will redirect to one another as needed.\r\n  * [I've created a tool to automatically handle this for you.](https://github.com/jaysonesmith/changelog_updater)\r\n  * Please use the template below for new files or for existing files, make sure that it includes the data below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# CHANGE LOG\r\n\r\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\r\n\r\nThis project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).\r\n\r\nThis document is formatted according to the principles of [Keep A CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com).\r\n\r\nPlease visit [cucumber/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on how to contribute to Cucumber.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## [Unreleased] - In Git\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* Added this CHANGELOG.md file per [cucumber/cucumber #251](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/251)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n<!-- Releases -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Contributors -->\r\n[username]:        https://github.com/username\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## List of Repos By Current Tracking Type\r\n*All below need to be updated/checked.

Normalization will help messaging be consistent across the board allowing different users to be able to read all history files across Cucumber regardless of which language specific repo of which they're most familiar.\r\n\r\n## Current Implementations\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* cucumber-ruby uses an `update-history` script to manage their `HISTORY.md` file\r\n* cucumber-js doesn't have a specific format to use for `CHANGELOG.md` but suggests using a specific `git log`.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nAslak suggested [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for our history files. This uses a clear format and groups things by type, similar to what we're doing today.\r\n\r\n### Questions/Tuning\r\n1. Naming: Should we use `History.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` across repos? \r\n  1a. Should what we decide on be in all caps?\r\n2. Every repo (imo) should have some sort of history tracking file so we'll need to go through and add them to repos that don't currently have them. \r\n  2a. Should we create a day forward file or try to wrangle past commit history into the files we create?\r\n3. Should we change our change 'types' to match KaC's guidance or continue to use our own?\r\n4. KaC does not include a method for including issue numbers, shall we just continue with including them as links at the end with the text being just the issue number?\r\n5. There are a lot of repos below that are listed as read-only, are mirrors, or are just stale overall. Should we be adding tracking files to these ones as well?\r\n6. Guidance: We should include a link at the top of each tracking file pointing to the master contributing file.\r\n7. Guidance: Similar to the Ruby repo, I would like each repo to have a local script that contributors run to update the tracking file with the issue tag. This way we can help keep formatting similar across repos and also enforce a 'newest first' ordering of issues. (Going to make this into its own Issue)\r\n\r\n"

I'd like it if Cucumber were reporting that scenario's status as `undefined`. In order to do this, we'd need to pass a pickle out of the compiler.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPickles compiler outputs pickles (with no steps) for scenarios with no steps.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nPickles compiler does not output a pickle for scenarios with no steps.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI'd love some pointers here. I've never worked on the pickles compiler, but if someone can show me where to start (and we're agreed on the idea), I'd have a go at this.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about how people like product owners engage with Cucumber, and that I'd guess they think of a scenario as having taken life as soon as they name it. It seems wrong to hide those scenarios from Cucumber."

In JavaScript we currently have to do this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { defineSupportCode } = require('cucumber')\r\nconst Coordinate = require('../../lib/coordinate')\r\n\r\ndefineSupportCode(function({ addParameterType }) {\r\n  addParameterType({\r\n    regexp: /\\d+,\\s*\\d+/,\r\n    transformer: intsString => {\r\n      const [_, x, y] = intsString.match(/(\\d+), (\\d+)/)\r\n      return new Coordinate(parseInt(x), parseInt(y))\r\n    },\r\n    typeName: 'coordinate'\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be a lot nicer if we could define it like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndefineSupportCode(function({ addParameterType }) {\r\n  addParameterType({\r\n    regexp: /(\\d+),\\s*(\\d+)/,\r\n    transformer: (x, y) => {\r\n      return new Coordinate(parseInt(x), parseInt(y))\r\n    },\r\n    typeName: 'coordinate'\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n"

We could make use of a keyword \"Link: \" &  explicitly mention the relative path to the file\r\n2. Use a keyword \"Link: \"& should be able to define the declaration as the file / image path.\r\n3.

    "body": "The following is a proposal for how cucumber could be built in the future. There is binary that is responsible for all shared logic (CLI parsing, reading gherkin files, compiling pickles, basic infrastructure running, formatting results). This binary would be written in go or some other language that allows us to compile binaries for each OS. Then there are a series of language specific libraries which use the binary to run tests.\r\n \r\nLogic for the language specific libraries:\r\n* If needed, fetch operating system specific binary (this could also be done during the install process where possible)\r\n  * Store in .cucumber/<version>\r\n* Execute binary as a child process (passing all command line options). Communicate with the binary over stdin / stdout via lines of JSON. The binary requests the language specific library to do the following things:\r\n  * Load support code\r\n    * Request includes: paths to load\r\n    * Reply with \r\n      * array of step definitions (id, expression text, expression type)\r\n      * array of parameter types (id, regular expression)\r\n  * Setup test run \r\n    * Run before all hooks - reply with possible error when done \r\n  * Setup test case\r\n    * Run before each hooks - reply with possible error when done\r\n  * Run test step\r\n    * Request includes\r\n      * Id\r\n      * Arguments (each has a parameter type ids if it needs to be transformed)\r\n    * Run step with given id - reply with possible error when done\r\n  * Teardown test case\r\n    * Run after each hooks - reply with possible error when done \r\n  * Teardown test run\r\n    * Run after all hooks - reply with possible error when done \r\n  * Print to stdout \r\n    * Request includes: text\r\n  * Print to stderr \r\n    * Request includes: text\r\n  * Exit\r\n    * Request includes: exit code\r\n  * Generate step definition snippet \r\n    * Request includes:\r\n      * Text\r\n      * Type - cucumber expression or regular expression\r\n    * Reply with a step definition snippet\r\n \r\nThis is similar to the cucumber wire protocol but built in a way that the ruby dependency is removed and allows language specific code to be the entry point.\r\n \r\nI want to spike this out on cucumber-js with the shared binary being written in node for the purposes of the spike. Primary goals would be to pull the language specific code and see how the interface feels.\r\n \r\nI’m uncertain how custom formatters / plugins would fit into this but those could potentially be done with a formatter streaming to a named pipe.\r\n \r\nPlease bring up any issues you can think of. I’m sure there are features in some of the other cucumber flavors that I am unaware of.\r\n"

    "body": "Currently, the only way to pass state between step definitions is by storing state as instance variables.\r\n\r\nThis is cumbersome in some languages, in particular for Java where it becomes tricky to share state between classes. DI is the only way to address this.\r\n\r\nFor other languages (such as Ruby and JavaScript) the `World` often becomes a huge object holding all kinds of different state used by various step definitions.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose an alternative API for Step Definitions where:\r\n\r\n* Each step definition (or hook) can return a value\r\n* This value is passed to the next step definition\r\n* Statically typed languages can use custom types\r\n\r\nThis would remove the need for a World or DI. It would reduce coupling and make it more explicit what is passed between step definitions.\r\n\r\nWe'll use this issue to discuss the implications of this in various implementations, and to come up with an API for various languages such as Java, Ruby and JavaScript (at least).\r\n\r\nOnce we're happy with the API we can create new issues to implement this in various Cucumbers.\r\n\r\n(I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm glad I am not the only one!

    "body": "_From @Jordyderuijter on May 23, 2017 11:4_\n\nHi there,\r\n\r\nIt seems like there is a bug in the RegularExpression class in the cucumber-expressions dependency.\r\nThe regex in this constructor looks for capturing groups when processing steps using the regex:\r\n\r\n `/\\(([^(]+)\\)/g`\r\n\r\nThis regex finds everything between braces (a.k.a. capturing groups), but it also accepts non-capturing groups. This causes the constructor to generate parameter types for the non capturing groups (instead of the capturing groups only). \r\n\r\nThese parameter types are used in the buildArguments function, but are only applied to capturing groups, since the given step regex filters out the non-capturing groups correctly.\r\n\r\nI would expect the RegularExpression constructor to filter out these capturing groups correctly.\r\n\r\nThe step and step definitions I used to reproduce the issue are:\r\n\r\nStep:\r\n`I can cancel the 1st slide upload`\r\n\r\nStep definition:\r\n`(\\S+) ?(can|cannot)? (?:delete|cancel) the (\\d+)(?:st|nd|rd|th) (attachment|slide) ?(?:upload)?`\r\n\r\nIn this case 7 parameter types are being generated by the constructor, while it should only create 4, since 3 of them are non-capturing groups. As a result, the parameter type that belongs to (\\d+) is being applied to (attachment|slide), treating it as an integer. This results into a NaN value that is being passed to my step definition.\r\n\r\nVersion info:\r\n\r\n- Cucumberjs: 2.1.0\r\n- Node: v6.9.1\r\n- Npm: 3.10.8\n\n_Copied from original issue: cucumber/cucumber-js#837_"

This has already been done in [Cucumber Expressions](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/cucumber-expressions), [Tag Expressions](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/tag-expressions) and of course, [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/gherkin).\r\n\r\nI think this implementation should be decoupled from the Gherkin library - it should *not* depend on Gherkin's [DataTable](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/gherkin/java/src/main/java/gherkin/ast/DataTable.java) implementation. Instead, it should be possible to construct a new `DataTable` object with a simple array of array of strings.\r\n\r\nFor this new implementation I would like data tables to support the Cucumber Expressions' custom [parameter types](https://docs.cucumber.io/cucumber-expressions/#custom-parameters).\r\n\r\nThis would allow users to define parameter types once, and use them both in steps and data table headers. For example:\r\n\r\n```gherkin\r\nGiven some stuff:\r\n  | color | currency |\r\n  | red   | GBP      |\r\n  | green | NOK      |\r\n  | blue  | EUR      |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe corresponding `DataTable` would then automatically convert columns to the right type.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in helping out building this new `DataTable` put your name below!"

    "body": "Hello,\r\nwe are using Cucumber quite a lot for functional tests (FT) at our project. It is quite big project and our usage of Cucummber is quite extensive. Now we are investigating how to work with Cucumber in reporting over time, trends, regresion tests and other statistics. We have even create internal reporting tool. \r\n\r\n## The problem is \r\nLets say we have Scenario Outline and it is passing for a realy long time. Scenario Outline looks like following example:\r\n```\r\nFeature:\r\n   Scenario Outline: \r\n     Given I have cucumber\r\n      When I \"<ACTION>\" cucumber\r\n      Then Cucumber \"<RESULT>\"\r\n    Examples:\r\n     | ACTION| RESULT                | \r\n     | throw    | explode               |\r\n     | hate      | vanish                  |\r\n     | love      | is in love with me |\r\n```\r\nBut one day one of scenario run fails. Lets say it was scenario run with data row  | throw  | explode |.\r\nSo we would like to add information about new bug occurrence to feature file via @Bug tag.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nTag @Bug represent failed scenario run due to bug. So feature file could look like this:\r\n```\r\nFeature:\r\n   Scenario Outline: \r\n     Given I have cucumber\r\n      When I \"<ACTION>\" cucumber\r\n      Then Cucumber \"<RESULT>\"\r\n    @Bug\r\n    Examples:\r\n     | ACTION| RESULT                | \r\n     | throw    | explode               |\r\n   Examples:\r\n     | ACTION| RESULT                | \r\n     | hate      | vanish                  |\r\n     | love      | is in love with me |\r\n```\r\nBut this solution does not feel right for me.\r\nLets say we would like to split bugs to (Frond End) FE and BE (Back End) or another division which make more sense.\r\n\r\n## Proposed enhancement\r\nPreferable solution: taggable data rows. So we could do something like:\r\n```\r\nFeature:\r\n   Scenario Outline: \r\n      Given I have cucumber\r\n      When I \"<ACTION>\" cucumber\r\n       Then Cucumber \"<RESULT>\"\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Examples:\r\n     | ACTION| RESULT                | \r\n     @Bug - apply only for this row\r\n     | throw    | explode               |\r\n     | hate      | vanish                  |\r\n     | love      | is in love with me |\r\n```\r\n\r\nTags on rows can have only documentation purpose so they will not affect if row is executed or not.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nV"

To encode code points from the [Supplementary Planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Supplementary_Multilingual_Plane) [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) are used (using two wide characters for each code point). The decoding of UTF-8 (which is done directly in the code) need to use UTF-16 in the internal wide character representation when necessary.\r\n* Always output UTF-8 encoded data (fixes #168).\r\nWindows generally does not use UTF-8, even when using unicode it is most likely UTF-16 and not UTF-8. Therefore it seems best to always do the UTF-8 encoding directly in the code, instead of relying on print functions form the complier libraries.\r\n* Avoid `swprintf`\r\nMany (older) Windows compilers use a different signature for `swprintf` than the ISO standard (excluding the count argument in the signature), therefore it is better to avoid using it and instead calculate the string representation of the error location directly (which was the only use of `swprintf`).\r\nAnother reason to avoid `swprintf` is that it did not exist in the ISO standard until C99.\r\n\r\nIn addition make the code conform to C90.\r\nAfter the use of `swprintf` was removed, only the use of `//` for some commented out code was only thing that inhibit the compilation of the code with GCC (>v4.6) using `-std=c90` (or `-ansi`), so the use of `//` was removed.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough using -std=c90` with GCC (>v4.6) did not complain on [repeated typedefs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8594954/repeated-typedefs-invalid-in-c-but-valid-in-c) even though they are not allowed until C11. GCC (<v4.6) on the other hand does not allow them at all, so they are removed.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nFixes #168.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nOn `OS name: \"linux\", version: \"4.8.0-36-generic\", arch: \"amd64\", family: \"unix\"` (ubuntu 16.04) using:\r\n* `gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609`\r\n* `clang version 3.8.0-2ubuntu4 (tags/RELEASE_380/final)`\r\n* `gcc (Alpine 6.2.1) 6.2.1 20160822` (docker)\r\n\r\nOn `OS name: \"linux\", version: \"4.4.0-72-generic\", arch: \"i386\", family: \"unix\"` (ubuntu 16.04) using:\r\n* `gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609`\r\n* `clang version 3.8.0-2ubuntu4 (tags/RELEASE_380/final)`\r\n\r\nOn `OS name: \"windows 7\", version: \"6.1\", arch: \"amd64\", family: \"windows\"` using:\r\n* `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc (GCC) 5.4.0`\r\n* `x86_64-pc-cygwin-gcc (GCC) 5.4.0`\r\n\r\nOn `OS name: \"windows xp\", version: \"5.1\", arch: \"x86\", family: \"windows\"` using:\r\n* `i686-pc-mingw32-gcc (GCC) 4.5.2`\r\n* `i686-pc-cygwin-gcc (GCC) 4.7.3`\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

A mistyped parameter name can cause unexpected results, such as parameters that don't get transformed.\r\n\r\nFurther, enforcing the use of explicit parameter types encourages more attention to building a consistent, ubiquitous language in Cucumber expressions and Cucumber scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #190 "

Using `string` instead would make it more readable/intuitive and it would standardise the behaviour in the cucumber-expression library, avoiding inconsistent behaviour on different cucumber implementations.\r\n"

    "body": "## Summary\r\nI'm linking to the issue that I created over in the cucumber-js repo [here](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/784) and the change that this relates to in the cucumber parent project repo [here](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/131) in order to trace back the whole conversation.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases in our step definitions where we have _a varity of repeated groups that don't change the steps functionality, but does do quite a bit for readablilty_ in the feature files:\r\n\r\n* \"must\"/\"should\"\r\n* optional words like \"the\", \"I\" etc that would match `Given I fill in \"Foo\"` & `And fill in \"Bar\"`\r\n* lists of interchangable words\r\n\r\nSay that you are using these alternatives across a large set of step definitions and you wish to change them all. This is where the problem (and the solution) both appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nChanged the regex that matches parameter groups to include square brackets as well as curly braces.\r\nLater on, a line to differentiate between the two types of braces - naming curly as capture and square as non-capture.\r\nLater still, an edit to the line that adds to the Regex, to make sure curly has capture group regex, and square has non-capture group regex.\r\n\r\nRemoved 3 tests that check that cucumber escapes square brackets - it now doesn't, as these are now special characters in cucumber-expressions. \r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nWe will be working with cucumber on a wide variety of projects in our company and I can guarantee that many of them will require a large number of declaratively written step definitions that require many alternatives that won't be captured for use within the step definitions.\r\n\r\nThis would make it easier for us to keep track of all of the alternatives that we will be using, and will mean that we wont have to search through the many step definition files for all of the uses..\r\n\r\nAnd I am certain that others in the cucumber community will be in the same situation as I.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI've done a set of tests for this, by checking the number of parameters needed in an example cucumber suite (I can load this to a repository on request). The square brackets now match with the transforms that we set, but do not pass a parameter, as they are optional.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![cucumber_code](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18209178/24831009/0386d0c6-1c89-11e7-8827-2000b36da2c9.png)\r\n\r\nNote: The two failures are intentional, to show that the code actually works\r\n![cucumber_running](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18209178/24831011/06df942e-1c89-11e7-905a-90e0d9221a09.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for my code.\r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n"

Since it's all JavaScript, no need to fork a separate process like many other linters do, so it should be fast.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nDeveloping this side by side with Gherkin Lint itself would allow us to do Gherkin Lint more \"consumer-driven\".\r\n"

It can act as a reference implementation for other Cucumbers to follow when implementing their own.\r\n\r\nKeeping the plugin here in the monorepo rather than in the cucumber-ruby codebase will enable other implementors to re-use tests (or perhaps we can even see how to develop a shared test suite).\r\n\r\nOnce this gem has been published, we'll use it as a dependency in Cucumber-Ruby 3.0, and make it one of the standard command-line options.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThe set of examples in `/event-protocol/ruby/examples` each contain an `expected-events.ndjson`. The RSpec tests for the project run Cucumber (with the plugin enabled) for each of the examples, and compare the output from the plugin with that file.\r\n\r\nBecause of some non-deterministic data in the events, the data is somewhat normalised before comparison. Read the code for details.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added tests for my code.\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n"

It also sets up a Travis build. \r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe docker image is based on Alpine Linux. The base image is `mhart/alpine-node` rather than `alpine` because the latter only has a nodejs package version 6 (we need 7).\r\n\r\nSome libraires are not built (or only partially built):\r\n\r\n* `gherkin/c` - compiled, but not tested - there is a failing test (bug)\r\n* `gherkin/dotnet` - there is no mono package for alpine yet\r\n* `gherkin/go` - there is no go package for alpine yet\r\n* `gherkin/objective-c` - there is no `xcodebuild` for Linux\r\n\r\nThere libraries are fully built in their subrepos' Travis builds, which do not run in Docker and therefore have more tooling available.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this PR is to have CI builds for contributor PRs.\r\n\r\nThe other reason is to make it easier for contributors to run tests locally without having to install a lot of software (just Docker).\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTravis runs the build!\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added tests for my code.\r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n"

To fix I had to make changes in how the files are read into the source events, which includes reading them into unicode strings. This rippled to some changes in the Parser since Python 2 differentiate between strings, `str`, and unicode-strings, `unicode`, (which both are subtypes to `basestring`), whereas Python 3 tread both string and unicode-strings as `str`. \r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nMake Gherkin work also in Python 3\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nAcceptance test has been executed both on Python 2 and Python 3.\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for my code.\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n"

If something doesn't fit, you can just skip it. -->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n* Extract a library so the validator can be used from other JavaScript programs.\r\n* Create a CLI so it can be used standalone after installing the npm package\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe lib is just a single function:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction validateEvent(event) {\r\n  // throws an error if the event is invalid\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nLibrary: Some programs (such as cucumber-gui) may want to validate incoming events before they are processed.\r\n\r\nCLI: Being able to use the validator as a CLI is easier when it can just be `npm install`ed. This makes it easier for developers of event producers to test that they are producing valid events.\r\n\r\nThe CLI reads events from `STDIN` and writes them to `STDOUT`, which makes it possible to use it just like `cat` in between two programs (a producer and a consumer).\r\n\r\nIf the CLI fails to parse or validate an event, a detailed error message is written to `STDERR` in red and stops processing further events.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nAs before - just run `make`. Change an event (or a schema) and run `make` again to see it fail.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

If something doesn't fit, you can just skip it. -->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nUse `rsync` to copy files to subrepos.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nEach subrepo that wishes to have copies of other files can declare what files or directories to copy in an `.rsync` file.\r\n\r\nThe `rsync_files` function from `scripts/functions.sh` can then be used to perform a sync.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\n\r\nThe subrepos such as `cucumber/gherkin-java`, `cucumber/gherkin-ruby` etc. haven't been autonomous prior to this change. Their `Makefile` would refer to files in the parent directory, which doesn't exist when the subrepo is cloned.\r\n\r\nThis poses a problem for CI, because the full test suite can't run unless all files are available.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nManually for now. As soon as this is merged and subrepos pushed, we'll fix any remaining issues highlighted by CI\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue).\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! -->\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for my code.\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n"

Since the values for `series` and `timestamp` will be dynamically generated at run-time and are non-deterministic, we won't be able to use static values for them in the test data.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to resolve this. How are those `testdata` files used? Could the tools that check them against the actual output be made more sophisticated to be flexible about the exact values of timestamp / series? What other options do we have?\n\n_Copied from original issue: cucumber/gherkin#258_"

Therefore, they both need to use the same regular expression.\r\n\r\nI would expect the code above to not throw any error, the constraint on regular expression uniqueness between parameter types to not be enforced. Two reasons for that:\r\n\r\n1. The types are always explicit in step definition expressions, therefore I think there is no ambiguity possible when identifying types and their transform functions.\r\n2. Enforcing regular expressions uniqueness is not robust anyway. I was able to circumvent this uniqueness constraint by using two different regular expressions exposing the exact same rules:\r\n  - `/[A-Z]\\w+/`\r\n  - `/[A-Z]\\w{1,}/`\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI think we can safely remove this check on regular expression uniqueness as long as type names are uniquely identified."

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nI'm linking to the issue that I created over in the cucumber-js repo [here](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/784) in order to trace back the whole conversation.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases in our step definitions where we have _a varity of repeated groups that don't change the steps functionality, but does do quite a bit for readablilty_ in the feature files:\r\n\r\n* \"must\"/\"should\"\r\n* optional words like \"the\", \"I\" etc that would match `Given I fill in \"Foo\"` & `And fill in \"Bar\"`\r\n* lists of interchangable words\r\n\r\nSay that you are using these alternatives across a large set of step definitions and you wish to change them all. This is where the problem (and the solution) both appear.\r\n\r\n## Current way of completing the task\r\n\r\nAt current, we can do alternatives like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nGiven('{pronoun} have/has {int} child(ren)', (pronoun, childCount) => {\r\n  // Code that does not require the \"pronoun\" parameter at all\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this does mean that we have a parameter that is never actually used in the step definition that we have and this is the only way of storing the list to be used in many differing steps.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nPerhaps square brackets could be used for things that don't need to be captured, but still require the transformation.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nGiven('[pronoun] have/has {int} child(ren)', (childCount) => {\r\n   // Code\r\n});\r\n\r\nWhen('[pronoun] picks up {stringInDoubleQuotes} from {stringInDoubleQuotes}', (child, place) => {\r\n   // Code\r\n});\r\n\r\nThen('[pronoun] should have {int} child(ren) in [pronoun] care', (childCount) => {\r\n  // Code\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnother plus side, is that if the parameter needs to be captured, the only difference would be the brackets that you use in that step definition:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  Then('{pronoun} does something', (pronoun) => {\r\n     if(pronoun == \"Jeff\"){\r\n        // Do something different for Jeff\r\n     } else {\r\n       // Do your thing\r\n     }   \r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nWe will be working with cucumber on a wide variety of projects in our company and I can guarantee that many of them will require a large number of declaratively written step definitions that require many alternatives that won't be captured for use within the step definitions.\r\n\r\nThis would make it easier for us to keep track of all of the alternatives that we will be using, and will mean that we wont have to search through the many step definition files for all of the uses..\r\n\r\nAnd I am certain that others in the cucumber community will be in the same situation as I.\r\n"

It is sufficient to give different names to the function/method parameters of the stepdef. \r\n* The `{name:type}` syntax is ugly and causes more visual/cognitive strain\r\n\r\nSo let's get rid of it! This PR prints a deprecation warning with a recommendation to `STDERR` if the `{name:type}` syntax is used. In a future release we can remove support for it altogether.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

However, only mime_type and data encoded from src are embedded to result json file. It would be better if also label is embedded to result.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI don't see into inner code of formatters but all what need to be done is change line:\r\n test_step_embeddings << { mime_type: mime_type, data: data }     \r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\ntest_step_embeddings << { mime_type: mime_type, data: data, label: label }\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm using reporter which transforms json to html report and it would be nice if i could get embeding label to know what screenshot belongs to what browser.\r\n"

And my IDEA is a bit complicated scrolling it and doing different comment/uncomment lines.\r\n\r\nCould I implement a thing similar to Examples block, but it would look like\r\n\r\nExample pairs:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"DB\": [MySQL_qanorthwind_cs,SQLServer_NGP,PostgreSQL_qanorthwind_cs,PostgreSQL_qanorthwind_cs_9_0,Infobright_logidatahub,Vertica_vmart_71,Oracle_LOGIXML],\r\n  \"column\":[Fifty_years,Twenty_years,Ten_years,Five_years,One_year,Six_months,Three_months,One_month,One_week,One_day],\r\n   \"argument_0\": [1,3,4,7,14,30,60,90],\r\n    \"argument_1\": [h,m,s,ms],\r\n    \"argument_2\": [true,false],\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd it should have the same behavior as example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExamples:\r\n      | DB                                     | binning_column | bin_width | bin_unit | outlier |\r\n      | MySQL_qanorthwind_cs | One_week_left_outlier | 1 | h | true |\r\n      | MySQL_qanorthwind_cs | One_week_left_outlier | 1 | h | false |\r\n      | MySQL_qanorthwind_cs | One_week_left_outlier | 1 | m | true |\r\n      | MySQL_qanorthwind_cs | One_week_left_outlier | 1 | m | false |\r\n      | MySQL_qanorthwind_cs | One_week_left_outlier | 1 | s | true |\r\n      | MySQL_qanorthwind_cs | One_week_left_outlier | 1 | s | false |\r\n.....\r\n      | Oracle_LOGIXML | One_day_null | 90 | h | true |\r\n      | Oracle_LOGIXML | One_day_null | 90 | h | false |\r\n      | Oracle_LOGIXML | One_day_null | 90 | m | true |\r\n      | Oracle_LOGIXML | One_day_null | 90 | m | false |\r\n      | Oracle_LOGIXML | One_day_null | 90 | s | true |\r\n      | Oracle_LOGIXML | One_day_null | 90 | s | false |\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you recommend the best way I could reduce examples to something like \"Example pairs\""

Try loading it directly in any project.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\nI'm using the tag parser as a simple method to filter documents by giving a user an easy dsl for working with document labels. Im also using it with angular (1.6) to allow me to find modules that rely on a certain group of dependencies (angular stores the dependency information as an array of strings). This library is actually really useful in a wide range of scenarios, outside of cucumber ones (pun intended 😁 ).\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\nEnvironment independent"

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nVS Code directly supports ANSI control sequences.  However, `cucumber` only looks for the presence of ANSICON, which means no color output for VS Code users.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nWithin `ansicolor.rb`, simply add an additional check for the presence of VS Code:\r\n```ruby\r\nunless ENV['ANSICON'] || ENV['VSCODE_PID']\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tested the above change with my local copy of the gem, and I am able to see the correct color output from `cucumber` in the VS Code integrated terminal.  I figured I would share this with the community, and let you folks consider whether it is worth including in the project.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I updated the environment variable above.  The previous value of `VSCODE_CLI` comes from running the `code.bat` file to launch VS Code.  If you launch VS Code from the start menu, then that variable is not defined.  However, `VSCODE_PID` appears to be a reliable indicator that you are running in the integrated terminal."

We want to be able to support this in cucumber. \r\nFor example if test 1 is about to be run it will check that server x and y are active, if not it will skip this test. \r\n  \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI have found a way to mimic this behaviour in cucumber except there seems to be a bug preventing us from doing it.\r\nTo mimic it I use tags(annotations) and the before command.\r\nIn the before command I check the state of the system, if the system is not how the test wants it then it will throw and org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException. This should cause the step to be skipped.\r\nHowever we see that this causes the test to fail. We are running our tests in strict mode. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nI have fixed it in a local clone of your repo. \r\nI made the following 2 changes to the file cucumber.runtime.Runtime./\r\nIn the runHookIfTagsMatch I added the section\r\n`\r\n    if(isBefore){\r\n                    status = isPending(t) ? \"skipped\" : Result.FAILED;\r\n                }else{\r\n                    status = isPending(t) ? \"pending\" : Result.FAILED;\r\n                }\r\n`\r\n \r\nAnd in the runStep I changed the line \r\n`\r\n      status = isPending(t) ? \"pending\" : Result.FAILED;\r\n`\r\nto \r\n`\r\n   status = isPending(t) ? \"skipped\" : Result.FAILED;\r\n`\r\n\r\nI my no means see this as a full solution and it is untested on other use cases but I would be happy to work with you guys to implement a full solution for this issue. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you regards, Paul \r\n\r\n"

Often the failure is due to simple mistyping by the user.

    "body": "## Summary\n\nCucumber does not offer a parallelization option out of the box.\n\nI'd like to get a Runtime option like \"--threads 4\". \nThe option will put all scenarios of all .features files in a queue. \nAs soon as a thread is idle, the thread will pick a scenario from the queue and execute it.\n\nI'd also like to have a tagging mechanism to forbid some scenarios to run in parallel if they are prone to interfere with each other.\n## Current Behavior\n\nMaven plugins or other external components tend to offer hacky ways to implement some sort of parallelism. \nThey almost all span multiple Cucumber processes, each one running a different .feature file, and then they run a process that merges all the JSON reports into one big report.json.\n\nI'm not happy with this situation because I (anybody can) have .feature files that vary in number, length, and duration of scenarios (depending on varying things like network load required by each scenario). \nThis results in having one thread taking very long to execute a bigger .feature file while other threads have finished executing all other small .feature files. \n## Expected Behavior\n\nGiven the current behavior, I'd like the parallelism to be smarter, to be optimal about execution time, and a better thread occupation efficiency.\n## Possible Solution\n\nFor our project, I've made a quick fork of Cucumber with this feature, and we use it with success:\nhttps://github.com/slaout/cucumber-jvm/tree/parallel-scenarios-execution-1.2.4\n\nIt has the following additions:\n- --threads parameter to tell Cucumber how much executor threads must be spanned\n- At the begin of the execution, all .feature files are scanned and all scenarios are put in a queue\n- Each thread picks a scenario to execute from the queue, and as soon as it finished, it picks another scenario from the queue\n- Some scenario needs to be synchronized:\n  - For instance, say two scenarios begin with setting the online stock of a product before testing it: they must be executed sequentially for no interference\n  - Say two other scenarios are modifying the in-store stock of a product before testing it: the two of them must also be executed sequentially BUT they can perfectly be executed in parallel with the first two scenarios that modify the online stock\n  - To get that behavior, all four scenarios are tagged with a tag starting with \"@synchronized-\". In this case, we will tag the two first scenarios with @synchronized-online-stock and the two others are tagged with @synchronized-store-stock\n  - Cucumber will group all scenarios with the same @synchronized- tag name in one \"execution group\" and will place them first in the queue, because they contain several not-parallelizable scenarios, so executing them first is more efficient if one group is quite large (imagine this large group being at the bottom of the queue: we would end up with the poor parallelization efficiency discussed in \"Current Behavior\" with other threads having finished their job and being idle)\n- Not implemented, but we could imagine the order of scenarios in the queue could be randomized, so if there are potential concurrency problems, they get spotted quicker, and developers can either fix the scenarios (and ensure scenarios are independent from each other, not just working by luck of current schedule) or add \"@synchronized-\" tags to concurrent scenarios.\n- Not implemented too, but some heuristics could put scenarios with a lot of steps at the start of the queue, as they could be longer to execute, which could lead to poorer threading efficiency (but as the gain could be marginal, it could as well not be implemented, it's just an idea)\n\nThe fork is launching multiple theads: each scenario has its own Formatter and Reporter: executing a scenario will \"print\" to those formater and reporter: hey will just record method calls in memory.\nAt the end, I list all scenarios in the order they are declarer and I tell the formater and reporter of these scenarios to replay what they memorized into the \"real\" formatter and reporter to construct the report.json exactly the same as it would have been created without parallelism.\nTo not change the code too much, I heavily added ThreadLocal variables and a few synchronized blocks where needed. \nA proper refactor of all the code base will be needed for it to be cleaner, but I read somewhere you were already planning to do so for the next major version of Cucumber.\n\nIt's developed mainly for the Java backend, but I think it would need basic adjustments to expose the new threads option to other languages.\nIt's done for the CLI runner. \nIt should work for the JUnit runner too, but because all reports are stored in memory and merged at the very end, the JUnit view of the IDE will not move in real time, and it will change all at once at the end.\n\nNote: this fork also contains the @ContinueNextStepsFor({Throwable.class}) evolution seen on issue #79.\nBecause our project needs both parallel execution and continuing execution on Then step failures.\n\nYou can see the changes introduced by the fork with this comparison:\nhttps://github.com/slaout/cucumber-jvm/compare/continue-next-steps-for-exceptions-1.2.4...slaout:parallel-scenarios-execution-1.2.4\nMainly:\n- ThreadLocals\n- synchronized blocks\n- added PlaybackFormatter (implements Reporter, Formatter): records all events of the current thread and is able to play them back to another instance that will merge the reports of all scenario executions in the expected order\n- added ProxyFormatter (implements Reporter, Formatter): just for debug purpose: will be removed\n- ScenarioExecutionRunnable.java\n- ThreadedRuntime.java\n"

The Cucumber Spring support doesn't currently check for this annotation so you have to add @ContextConfiguration as well as @SpringBootTest in order for Cucumber to initiate the bootstrapping of the Spring container.\n\nSee [issue on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38836337/cucumber-with-spring-boot-1-4-dependencies-not-injected-when-using-springboott/40104607#40104607)\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen running cucumber tests against a Spring app, the @SpringBootTest annotation should be sufficient on a Spring test container class in order to bootstrap the container.\n\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\n<!--- Feel free to use Given / Then / Then if that helps, but please add some plain-language context too -->\n## Current Behavior\n\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n\n<!--- If you have got some output place it in the code block below.

    "body": "## Summary\n\nAdd the possibility to being able to mark some \"Then\" step-definitions so that when they fail, they still mark the result as failed, but continue executing the next steps of the scenario.\n## Current Behavior\n\nSometimes, you have such Cucumber scenario:\n\n``` gherkins\nWhen I do some extensive computation like loading a heavy web page\nThen I check thing 1\nAnd I check thing 2\nAnd I check thing 3\nAnd So on\n```\n\nIn this particular situation:\n- all four \"Then\" have no impact on the rest of the execution of the scenario\n- they are all independent\n- if \"I check thing 1\" fails, the other 3 \"Then\"s are in a Schrödinger state: they may be OK, or they may fail, but we will know for sure only after we fix and re-execute the failed step, possibly many times if there are many errors, until all is fine. These retry/fix rountrips can be costly if the number of scenarios and steps are big and if execution is slow, like when testing a heavy website (a pretty common use case of Cucumber).\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe step-definitions developer should be able to tell that one particular step is an assertion that have no impact on the following steps of the scenario it's used in.  \nHe/she could then add an annotation on that step-definition to allow Cucumber to continue the next steps executions if that one fails.\n\nSee [the discussion on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cukes/xTqSyR1qvSc).\n## Possible Solution\n\nI've made this Cucumber fork for our own needs:  \n[github.com/slaout/cucumber-jvm](https://github.com/slaout/cucumber-jvm/tree/continue-next-steps-for-exceptions-1.2.4)\n\nPlease read the README.md for an explanation and our return of experience on this subject.\n\nIt's only working on the Java backend.\n\nSee [the discussion on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cukes/xTqSyR1qvSc) for people proposing to port it to Ruby, for instance.\n\nPlease tell me if the fork is a good starting point for you and you would like me to transform this fork into a Pull Request.\n"

Ideally in JavaScript since it's easier to use on the web, and also relatively easy to embed into other libraries as well as editors and IDEs.\n\nIf you're interested, just reply here and fill out [this doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/xae79nkgu3zsrt2c) for a google hangout kickoff meeting.\n\n/cc @enkessler @allustin @vsiakka @r-cochran\n"

    "body": "Hello, right now I see that cucumber does:\n1. step regular expression matching\n2. step transformation\n\nI am trying to understand why that has been chosen. To me it makes more sense to do it the other  way around. i.e. first transform and then match the steps.\n\nIn our test suite we decided to make `<%= ... %>` expressions expand to some ruby expression inside. Issue is that if step for example matches `\\w+` then using such expression in place doesn't work. It is not such a big deal as quotes can be used for parameters. Just a little harder to write the quotes.\n\nBut I thought to propose making transformation happen before matching unless there are good reasons to keep current approach.\n\nThank you.\n"

    "body": "Hello, I observe the following behavior.\n= regular cucumber vs SIGINT\n- test is running\n- hit ctrl+c\n- test continue to be running and program exits only after it completes fully\n- hit ctrl+c again\n- cucumber exits without any clean-up taking place\n\n= cucumber with `Signal.trap('SIGINT') { exit(false) }`\n- test running\n- hit ctrl+c\n- test terminates and cucumber switches to After hook\n\nI think that the latter behavior makes much more sense. If user wants to interrupt, then ideally that will happen as soon as possible while After hook is executed to clean-up any underlying test environment. This is current behavior for SIGTERM.\n\nSo I was wondering what was the idea behind default SIGINT trap behavior. Why not keep same as SIGTERM? Not a big issue for me as I have a workaround. But would be nice to make behavior more convenient OOB for other users.\n\nbtw very nice cucumber takes care to run `After` hook on SIGTERM. I made some effort to put clean-up in `at_exit` when `After` is skipped but it seems `After` is never skipped. Or was the idea to have single Ctrl+C terminate after scenario finish, second Ctrl+C to drop into `After` hook? In such case it is not working like that.\n"

    "body": "@aslakhellesoy @jbpros @mattwynne \n\nThis is a rework of the progress formatter output that I am thinking about for cucumber-js and wanted to bring up to the whole cucumber community. Please tag anyone else you think should see this \n\nGiven a feature:\n\n``` cucumber\nFeature: A feature\n\n  Scenario: 1\n    Given a passing step\n\n  Scenario: 2\n    Given a passing step\n    And a failing step\n    And a skipped step\n\n  Scenario: 3\n    Given a passing step\n    And a ambiguous step\n    And a skipped step\n\n  Scenario: 4\n    Given a passing step\n    And a undefined step\n    And a skipped step\n\n  Scenario: 5\n    Given a passing step\n    And a pending step\n    And a skipped step\n```\n\nThe current progress formatter output is\n\n```\n..F-.A-.U-.P-\n\n(::) failed steps (::)\n\nError: error\n    at World.<anonymous> (/.../features/step_definitions/steps.js:5:11)\n\nFailing scenarios:\nfeatures/a.feature:6 # Scenario: 2\n\n5 scenarios (1 failed, 1 undefined, 1 ambiguous, 1 pending, 1 passed)\n13 steps (1 failed, 1 undefined, 1 ambiguous, 1 pending, 4 skipped, 5 passed)\n0m00.003s\n\nYou can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:\n\nthis.Given(/^a undefined step$/, function (callback) {\n  // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions\n  callback.pending();\n});\n\n\nThe following steps have multiple matching definitions:\n\n\"a ambiguous step\" matches:\n/^an? ambiguous step$/ # features/step_definitions/steps.js:8\n/^a ambiguous step$/   # features/step_definitions/steps.js:9\n```\n\nThe fact that failed steps only lists the errors without the context (the scenario and step) has always bugged me and almost always made me rerun with pretty formatter the failing test in order to understand the context. I also dislike the that the different issues are shown in different places. \n\nI propose the following new output\n\n```\n..F-.A-.U-.P-\n\nIssues:\n\n1) Scenario: 2 # features/a.feature:6\n  Given a failing step # features/step_definitions/steps.js:4\n    Error: error\n      at World.<anonymous> (/.../features/step_definitions/steps.js:5:11)\n\n\n2) Scenario: 3 # features/a.feature:11\n  Given a ambiguous step\n    Multiple step definitions match:\n      /^an? ambiguous step$/ # features/step_definitions/steps.js:8\n      /^a ambiguous step$/   # features/step_definitions/steps.js:9\n\n3) Scenario: 4 # features/a.feature:16\n  Given a undefined step\n    Use the following snippet to implement this step\n      this.Given(/a undefined step/, function(){\n        // Write code to here to turn the step into concrete actions\n        callback.pending();\n      })\n\n4) Scenario: 5 # features/a.feature:21\n  Given a pending step # features/step_definitions/steps.js:11\n    Pending\n\n5 scenarios (1 failed, 1 undefined, 1 ambiguous, 1 pending, 1 passed)\n13 steps (1 failed, 1 undefined, 1 ambiguous, 1 pending, 4 skipped, 5 passed)\n0m00.003s\n```\n\nThoughts?\n"

    "body": "( This is just a spur-of-the-moment thought I had.  Request For Comments! ;) )\n\n---\n\nI like how cucumber/gherkin3 is organized: each implementation has its own repository, but the parent repository is where all the collaboration happens.  This allows for some flexibility between the different Gherkin 3 implementations, but uses the centralization of the parent repository to prevent any significant divergence (including some that were proposed by me :P).  \n\nI think it also promotes cross-pollination between people who arrive from different implementations.  When a user asks “Why X?” or “Why not Y?”, it’s easy to say “Because of the big picture Z”.  (It’s much easier than saying “Go see «other repository»/«other issue»”.  And from the user side of the fence, it also “feels” easier to receive this answer and see an issue from the _same) repository; the other implementations are right there in the parent repository, too, which is also nice.)\n\n---\n## And now, the questions!\n- (parent project) **Would it be beneficial to organize the Cucumber projects similarly?**\n- (each implementation) **What about a separate “`cucumber-tests`” project?**<br>\n  I imagine something like the following:\n  - This `cucumber-tests` project would contain features, but no step definitions\n  - Each cucumber implementation would supply its own step definitions, and get tested against the features in `cucumber-tests`\n  - Each implementation could (optionally) go further and provide its own features for the truly implementation-specific behaviors\n\n---\n\nI was browsing some of the features for the different cucumber implementations (in response to your good feedback on #8) when this occurred to me.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

It took me two hours of searching to find that page. I suggest renaming it to something like \"Configuring the scenario execution context (World)\"\n"

    "body": "Regular expressions in step definitions should always be part of Cucumber, but we should provide a simpler alternative for those who wish. Good Gherkin shouldn't require the complexities of RegExp anyway - if it does it's usually a sign the Gherkin is too complicated.\n\nThere are already several alternative pattern syntaxes out there, which has been discussed in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cukes/0j_5u9zkZng/1rbOOVDzHMcJ).\n\nThere are also some interesting alternatives on [this c2 page](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternativesToRegularExpressions) and [this HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9751555).\n\nSome things to consider:\n- Cucumber should be able to print snippets in the new expression syntax\n- A spec and common test suite for different implementations\n- The various language implementations should live in separate repos\n- It should compile down to RegExp (probably)\n### Completion\n\nThe new syntax must be implemented on the following platforms before we can close this issue\n- [ ] cucumber-ruby\n- [ ] cucumber-jvm\n- [ ] cucumber-js\n- [ ] specflow\n"
