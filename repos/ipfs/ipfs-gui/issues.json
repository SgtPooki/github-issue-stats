Its intent wouldn't be to ensure interoperability but display interoperability gaps. \r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nThe goal of this new product/feature is multi-purpose:\r\n\r\n1. A single location where all IPFS implementations and their functionality can be seen\r\n2. Encourage/foster the creation, and performance improvements, of the different implementations\r\n3. Support users' awareness of different implementations to simplify decision-making when deciding which implementation may be right for them\r\n4. Encourage the adoption of certain features/functionality by an implementation via pressure from the community\r\n\r\n## Things that we shouldn't cover\r\n\r\n* interoperability tests - ipfs/interop is a fairly large beast, and one thing I don't want this product to become is another huge maintenance burden. interoperability tests and insurance should remain in ipfs/interop, where they belong.\r\n* infantile implementations - Implementations that do not pass a minimum bar (to be set) should not be included. We should have a minimum feature set that implementations must support to be included in the list. Without this barrier to entry, it would be too easy for this tool to become a list of incomplete and unmaintained implementations\r\n* features that are too low-level - Displaying the support of different block encodings or other minutia could easily bog down the usefulness of this feature. The idea is not to cover every single thing an implementation can do, but instead to display which implementations support the most up-to-date and recommended things.\r\n   * i.e. don't show nuance of `dag-*` support. Show that `dag-cbor` (or whatever is currently recommended) blocks can be added, removed, etc.. \r\n\r\n## Proposal (TBD)\r\n\r\nA lot of the work for this tool already exists elsewhere, so I don't want to duplicate that work. Instead, we should utilize existing tools to perform the functionality testing, and instead, focus this tool on rendering the resulting pass/fail for displayed features.\r\n\r\nHow we could consolidate the existing tests without duplicating work still needs to be fleshed out, but I wanted to ensure I wrote down my thoughts on this before investing too heavily.\r\n\r\n## Additional thoughts\r\n\r\n* We could display benchmarking results to facilitate community pressure on certain implementations to speed up features & functionality that are slower than other implementations, but this could easily be its own tool.\r\n* We may want to expand this tool to support minutia (`dag-*` and other microcosms of functionality) in the future, but I don't think we should start there. \r\n* We could systematize `ipfs/interop` to be the foundation for this product, and make it easier to add implementations and feature tests.

We can of course host it on any static resoruce server. I've not explored it further as it seems like we'd want to have a very comfortable and clear UI for reporting incidents, as those situations are stressful enough.

We want shareable preview urls, and a simple mechanism for promoting a preview to the live verison.\n\nPrior art:  \n- [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) - set the bar for simple website publishing... just  run `surge` from the directory you want to publish\n- [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) - introduced us to the idea of immutable deploys, but publishing each \n\nHow about **\"pin sites to an ipfs cluster, as a service, and github app\"**\n\n**Example usage**\n```\nipfsify ./build\nAdding to IPFS...\nPinning on cluster.ipfs.dev...\nPreview ready https://bafywoowoo.ipfs.dev\n```\n\nThe command would add a site locally, and pin the CID to the remote cluster. You get an _immutable deploy_ style url like `https://bafywoowoo.ipfs.dev` that loads fast as the content is already on more than one machine, and one of them is an always available cluster that we look after.\n\n..._some preview builds later_...\n\n`me:` Ok that CID is hot! I wish to publish it!\n\n`bot:` OK, as this a new site, let me create a IPNS keypair for you. Here it is, dont lose it. I'm going to host it for you and point it to that new CID you gave me, _and_ reliably reannounce it every few hours for you... do  you have a legacy dns name you'd like to map it to?\n\n`me:` sure do, it's oli.zilla.org.uk, what of it?\n\n`bot:` ok, go set this txt record on your dns provider `dnslink=/ipns/Quink`...\n\n`me:` done! \n\n`bot:` ok, performing the lets encrypt dance... done. https://oli.zilla.org.uk is go, dweb style.\n\n---\n\nThis need has come up multiple times, from mutliple folks. Right now there are a bunch of PL sites that need this service. We've got a reasonable service in place via circleci, but the drawbacks  are\n- using the main gateway for hosting. we dont want to add load to them for every site we host\n- using the main cluster for pinning. This use-case can use its own cluster.\n- https config is manual\n- we have to update an ipfs dnslink via a dnsimple token for every build we want to promote to live... why not just use ipns.\n- we can't enable the circleci builds for PRs from forks as we'd risk exposing our dns token. This sucks as we want to enable this process for everyone.\n\nAn extension to this idea is to have a github action that builds, pins and updates the status on your PR with the preview url (done, here: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-github-action)\nand a github app that is notified when your master branch changes, and triggers the ipns update automagically.\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTI5MDEwNg==","author":{"login":"cwaring"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"+1 to more conversational issues 😂\r\n\r\n@scout and I were talking about this same idea/service just a couple of days ago.
