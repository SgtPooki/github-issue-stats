Is it an intentional design feature in cucumber?\r\n\r\nTo clarify: \r\nOnce cucumber begins to run (i.e. BeforeFeatures hook fires), the entire future test-flow has already been loaded and sequenced in memory. The features are ordered, and within each of them, the scenario order has been determined (all of them passed the run parameters tag filtering, of course).\r\n\r\nIt could be very helpful to manipulate this structure in ways that will affect the future test flow. These manipulations include:\r\n\r\n**Skipping scenarios and features** - For example, say my selenium connection timed out on one of the ui tests, and I know from here on I'll just be waisting time trying to setup any other ui test. I would rather be able to skip any future scenario marked with `@ui` for this test run.\r\n\r\n**Adding scenarios and features** - Some test environments are extremely asynchronous. i.e. some business processes may take several minutes (or more) to complete. A test that initiates an operation can add a validation scenario to the end of the test flow and allow all the other tests to run in between. Current solutions require the tests to be \"forced\" into the correct order by naming conventions, and the end-of-the-stack tests are ran even if the initiating scenarios failed.\r\n\r\n**Reordering scenarios and features** - There can be reasons for running tests in different order in different situations. If it were possible to manipulate the features payload in BeforeFeatures, the infrastructure implementer could account for environment / launch parameters and manipulate the stack accordingly.\r\n\r\nThese are just some examples of the top of my head."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/874","id":240252679,"number":874,"title":"multiple asynchronous interfaces: update error message","user":{"login":"charlierudolph","id":1676758,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1676758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph","html_url":"https://github.com/charlierudolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlierudolph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":527724149,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"0e8a16","default":true},{"id":522562057,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/labels/newcomers","name":"newcomers","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-03T19:47:25Z","updated_at":"2017-08-05T02:34:13Z","closed_at":"2017-08-05T02:34:13Z","body":"Currently if a function takes in a callback and returns promise, then this results in the error message: \r\n```\r\nfunction uses multiple asynchronous interfaces: callback and promise\r\n```\r\nHowever, this can be a confusing error message if someone leaves an extra parameter in the step definition and thus is not intentionally using the callback interface.

PR upgrades to [Cucumber Expressions 4.0.0](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/cucumber-expressions/CHANGELOG.md#400---2017-06-27)\r\n\r\nThere are backwards incompatible changes in this release, which might warrant a major version bump in cucumber-js too:\r\n\r\n## Parameter types must be defined\r\n\r\nUsing an `{undefined}` parameter type will result in an error. This may sound like a hassle, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks in my opinion.\r\n\r\nForcing users to define parameter types encourages the evolution of a ubiquitous language.\r\n\r\n## New `{word}` and `{string}` parameter types\r\n\r\nThe `{word}` type is handy to use instead of old `{undefined}` ones.\r\nThe `{string}` type replaces the old `{stringInDoubleQuotes}` one, and works with both single and double quotes\r\n\r\n## Parameter types can use the same regex\r\n\r\nThis used to cause errors in previous releases. Because they are now allowed, each undefined step\r\ncan result in several possible cucumber expressions for snippets, as outlined in https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/132.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the `CucumberExpressionGenerator.generateExpression` method is deprecated in favour of `CucumberExpressionGenerator.generateExpressions`, which returns a list of `GeneratedExpression` (the one at index 0 is the one the user is most likely to want).\r\n\r\nSo before this PR is merged, it should be updated to use the new method, and display all expressions when printing snippets. As discussed with @charlierudolph at cukeup, we're not sure how to best do that. Let's discuss some possible output examples in this issue before proceeding.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/pull/868","id":239235778,"number":868,"title":"use

One of its steps suddenly becomes ambiguous because of a new step definition. That scenario will be reported as ambiguous, which is not considered a failure (Cucumber's return code is still 0).

Where I'm discussing the changes on syntax about how to use protractor to execute Cucumberjs scripts.\r\n\r\nAs requested by @wswebcreation [https://github.com/wswebcreation](url), I closed that other issue and opened a new one here.\r\n\r\n# So, my last comment was this....\r\n\r\nThe last record I have of a successful execution was on 12 May 2017, 14:03. Precisely the date in your document.\r\n\r\nYour example about tags is very simplistic... how then should I call for 3 tags, two that must be executed and one that is ignored. Before May 12, this used to work fine, but now it doesn't:\r\n\r\n`protractor ./FM_IntTest_UI_conf.js --disableChecks --params.login.email=mytest@email.com --params.login.passw=mypassword --cucumberOpts.tags ~@ignore --cucumberOpts.tags @smoke,@sprint`\r\n\r\nYour document says now it should be like this, but doesn't work, returns same error message I submitted with the \"ticket\".\r\n\r\n`protractor ./FM_IntTest_UI_conf.js --disableChecks --params.login.email=mytest@email.com --params.login.passw=mypassword --cucumberOpts.tags '@smoke or @rt' --cucumberOpts.tags 'not @ignore'`\r\n\r\nError: Error: more than one config file specified\r\nat C:\\Users\\echavez\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\protractor\\built\\cli.js:155:15\r\nat C:\\Users\\echavez\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\protractor\\node_modules\\optimist\\index.js:307:21\r\nat Array.forEach (native)\r\nat parseArgs (C:\\Users\\echavez\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\protractor\\node_modules\\optimist\\index.js:305:16)\r\nat Object.Argv.self.parse (C:\\Users\\echavez\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\protractor\\node_modules\\optimist\\index.js:140:16)\r\nat Object.

Why making it more complicated now? Because with the new syntax, I must group steps by scenarios. But there are some steps that are repeated in several scenarios, thus repeating code on each scenario? I will end up with redundancies in my code. Why?\r\n\r\nHere's a snippet of what I have NOW in my test.spec.js file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.Given('I am testing my Widget Application', function (callback) {\r\n\tedirp.edirejectwidgetlink.click().then(function(){ \r\n\t\tcallback();\r\n\t}).catch(function(reason) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log('ERROR: Widget button not found');\r\n\t\tcallback(reason);\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\nthis.When('There are records in the Widget List', function() {\r\n\tedirp.edigetrow.count().then(function(cnt){\r\n\t\tif(cnt>0){\r\n\t\t\treturn recordsFound = cnt;\r\n\t\t}else{\r\n\t\t\treturn recordsFound = 0;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.Then('Header name of the Widget List is '(.+)'', function(header, callback) {\r\n\texpect(po.headertext.getText()).to.eventually.equal(header).then(function(){ \r\n\t\tcallback();\r\n\t}).catch(function(reason) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log('Warning: Incorrect Text.');\r\n\t\tcallback(reason);\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\nHere's a snippet of what is proposed as an \"update\"... for me is a DOWNGRADE:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar seleniumWebdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');\r\nvar {defineSupportCode} = require('cucumber');\r\n\r\ndefineSupportCode(function({Given, When, Then}) {\r\n  Given('I am testing my Widget Application', function (callback) {\r\n\tedirp.edirejectwidgetlink.click().then(function(){ \r\n\t\tcallback();\r\n\t}).catch(function(reason) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log('ERROR: Widget button not found');\r\n\t\tcallback(reason);\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n  When('There are records in the Widget List', function() {\r\n\tedirp.edigetrow.count().then(function(cnt){\r\n\t\tif(cnt>0){\r\n\t\t\treturn recordsFound = cnt;\r\n\t\t}else{\r\n\t\t\treturn recordsFound = 0;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n  Then('Header name of the Widget List is '(.+)'', function(header, callback) {\r\n\texpect(po.headertext.getText()).to.eventually.equal(header).then(function(){ \r\n\t\tcallback();\r\n\t}).catch(function(reason) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log('Warning: Incorrect Text.');\r\n\t\tcallback(reason);\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIf the scenario has several Given, When, Then... do those have to be enumerated here, like this?:\r\ndefineSupportCode(function({Given, And, And, When, And, And, Then, And, And, And}) {\r\n\r\nIf that's is true... So now, if I want to use again the step \"When There are records in the EDI-Rejects Widget\" in another scenario in my feature, do I need to code all the function again?\r\n\r\nAll I need are answers with arguments.

BDD all the way! Yey! Ok, cool.... so, cucumberjs has been chosen to help out (ignore any BDD theory discussions here please). We have js being used on both the client and server side. On the client side, we have (View/ViewModel/Model etc) separation of concerns in our classes all done nicely (using typescript but that's irrelevant) and systemJs as our module loader (used by aurelia in this case).\r\n\r\nI don't want to jump into 'use jasmine etc' for unit tests and cucumber for e2e tests, as I think this is looking at it the wrong way around. I want to start with cucumber for everything and only if I feel there's a need, use jasmine etc for specific purposes. Aside, I've seen far too many projects with a 'definition' in feature files and a different 'definition' written in jasmine specs.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nAFAIK this isn't possible, as node loads the cucumber step definitions and that's that. Can this be changed so that systemJs could load the modules?\r\n\r\nTo be explicit: On a test-by-test basis I want to have a test case in a feature file and decide to check it in the browser (traditional e2e cucumber-protractor testing), or in node (more akin to unit testing). This is made possible by testing non-browser dependent features and would commonly test ViewModels/DomainModels etc.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would require running cucumber twice with the different configurations but that is ok by me, and I expect to tag the scenarios with 'ui' in, for example, browser tests, of which I hope to have very few.\r\n\r\nIs this easy to do? Likely to be done soon? I'm happy to look at creating a PR if you can point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/838","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/838/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/838/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/838/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/pull/838","id":231363420,"number":838,"title":"pass the step definition options to function wrapper","user":{"login":"lgandecki","id":4002543,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4002543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki","html_url":"https://github.com/lgandecki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgandecki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-25T14:55:06Z","updated_at":"2017-06-10T10:20:01Z","closed_at":"2017-06-10T01:05:31Z","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/pulls/838","html_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/pull/838","diff_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/pull/838.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/pull/838.patch"},"body":"It would be helpful to have the options available in the wrapper.\r\nThen I can do something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndefineSupportCode(function ({setDefinitionFunctionWrapper}) {\r\n    setDefinitionFunctionWrapper(function (fn, options) {\r\n        let retryTest = isFinite(options.retry) ?

This causes the constructor to generate parameter types for the non capturing groups (instead of the capturing groups only). \r\n\r\nThese parameter types are used in the buildArguments function, but are only applied to capturing groups, since the given step regex filters out the non-capturing groups correctly.\r\n\r\nI would expect the RegularExpression constructor to filter out these capturing groups correctly.\r\n\r\nThe step and step definitions I used to reproduce the issue are:\r\n\r\nStep:\r\n`I can cancel the 1st slide upload`\r\n\r\nStep definition:\r\n`(\\S+) ?(can|cannot)? (?:delete|cancel) the (\\d+)(?:st|nd|rd|th) (attachment|slide) ?(?:upload)?`\r\n\r\nIn this case 7 parameter types are being generated by the constructor, while it should only create 4, since 3 of them are non-capturing groups. As a result, the parameter type that belongs to (\\d+) is being applied to (attachment|slide), treating it as an integer. This results into a NaN value that is being passed to my step definition.\r\n\r\nVersion info:\r\n\r\n- Cucumberjs: 2.1.0\r\n- Node: v6.9.1\r\n- Npm: 3.10.8"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/836","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/836/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/836/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/836/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/836","id":230323293,"number":836,"title":"scenario out use jsondata as param","user":{"login":"imzengyang","id":22312483,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22312483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang","html_url":"https://github.com/imzengyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imzengyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-22T08:40:33Z","updated_at":"2017-06-04T23:55:03Z","closed_at":"2017-06-04T23:55:03Z","body":"<!-- Please use the [support](https://cucumber.io/support) forums for questions \r\nand discussions which are not related to documentation updates, bug reports, or feature requests -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please search for related issues and check the documentation\r\nbefore opening a new issue -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If your issue is related to other tools (protractor, nightwatch, etc),\r\nplease open an issue on the related tool first and only open an issue here once\r\nyou have confirmed the issue is with cucumber -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are reporting a bug, please include a minimal reproducible example\r\nwith the following environment information: cucumber version, node or browser version,\r\noperating system -->\r\nHI! i am using cucumer js to test my service API. and the API use JSON data. here is my feature:\r\n```\r\nScenario Outline: test get method to service api\r\n    When get the service api \"<url>\" and i should get the \"<result>\"\r\n    Examples: \r\n      | url                           | result                                                                                                               |\r\n      | http://localhost:3000/users/1 | {   \"id\": 1,   \"name\": \"therebelrobot\",   \"location\": \"USA\" }                                                        |\r\n      | http://localhost:3000/users/2 | {   \"id\": 2,   \"name\": \"visiting-user\",   \"location\": \"UK\" }                                                         |\r\n      | http://localhost:3000/posts/1 | {   \"id\": 1,   \"title\": \"json-mock\",   \"body\": \"The internet is cool!\",   \"author\": \"therebelrobot\",   \"userId\": 1 } |\r\n```\r\n\r\nand when run cucumber-js. i get the Undefined waring, and then code is \r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n  @getPost\r\n  Scenario: test get method to service api\r\n  ?
